That said, they have a stated interest in promoting "a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society.Also, they\'ve recently won an award at WSIS for <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/Homepage/fs/en">DirectGov</a>, a website that brings together a mess of information about UK government services. </p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"December 19, 2005",path:"/2005/12/19/the-digital-dashboard-graphing-ict-change",title:"The Digital Dashboard: Graphing ICT Change",tags:["dashboard","design","ict4gov","access"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
