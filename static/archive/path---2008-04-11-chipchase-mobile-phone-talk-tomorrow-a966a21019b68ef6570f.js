If you live in a country like India, China or Ghana the answer is likely to involve the vibrant used phone market and, somewhere along the line the informal repair cultures - guys on the street who appear able to fix pretty much anything using little more than a flat surface a screwdriver and knowledge.\n<p>This presentation will highlight the mobile phone hacking skills available on the streets of cities from Accra and beyond, the sophisticated ecosystem of reverse engineered repair manuals and highlight how it challenges our thinking about what it means to make, distribute our products. The presentation will introduce Remade - a phone made from upcycled and recycled products.</blockquote></p>\n<p>Here\'s the link on Upcoming: <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/466964/">http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/466964/</a></p>\n<p>Via <a href="http://www.peterme.com/">Peter Merholtz</a> and <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2008/04/01/april-9-jan-chipchase-and-duncan-burns-from-nokia-design-at-adaptive-path/">AP</a>. </p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"April 11, 2008",path:"/2008/04/11/chipchase-mobile-phone-talk-tomorrow",title:"Chipchase mobile phone talk tomorrow",tags:["mobile","hack","street"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
