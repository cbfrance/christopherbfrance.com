Click on the button that says "Hybrid" on the upper right. You will get an image with a speech ballon pointing to a thumbtack showing the location of the address on the satellite photo. [IMPORTANT UPDATE: Bless their hearts, Google Maps has added a "KATRINA" button to New Orleans areas searches, so they have automated some of the process I describe here! Yee haw!]</p>\n<p>Step 2: Click up and down the vertical ladder-like bar to see the image at various scales until you feel you can find the place on a satellite image.</p>\n<p>Step 3: Compare your image to this superimposition of the FEMA flood map on a New Orleans satellite photo, created by the Google Earth Current Events Community. Here is a small version. Click on it for a much bigger picture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<img alt="nola_fema_floodmap" src="/static/images/nola_fema_floodmap.jpg" >\n<p>If the address you are checking is fairly centrally located, you can also check your address image against the DigitalGlobe satellite picture of the flooding. </p>\n<p>For more detailed instructions, visit <a href="http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/2005/09/how_to_find_out.html">her blog</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"September 06, 2005",path:"/2005/09/06/google-maps-is-my-house-underwater",title:"Google Maps: Is My House Underwater?",tags:["maps","katrina"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
