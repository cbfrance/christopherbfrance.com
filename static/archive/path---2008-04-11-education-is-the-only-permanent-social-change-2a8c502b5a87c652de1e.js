I mean, really how else does anything actually get done? You've got to have some kick ass teachers along the way, or you're gonna be a vegetable. And vegetabledom happens to entire societies. Watch out. </p>\n<p>So I'm a little depressed that I don't get to work directly in the education sector anymore â€” I used to have a great time working on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_evaluation\">educational evaluation</a> projects, and for a time I was a mentor. Now I'm a full time geek staring at an LCD, and I don't so much ever get the thrill of seeing kids make the grand connections. (read: manipulating young minds, bwah ha ha.) </p>\n<p>Anyway, just watched a great TED video from Dave Eggers. <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/233\">Give it 20 minutes</a> and tell me if you don't want to sign up to be a volunteer. It's a hilarious talk anyway, even if you hate kids. </p>\n<p>[http://static.videoegg.com/ted/movies/DAVEEGGERS-2008_high.flv]\n</p>",frontmatter:{created_at:"April 11, 2008",path:"/2008/04/11/education-is-the-only-permanent-social-change",title:"Education is the only permanent social change",tags:["education","sf","nptech"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
