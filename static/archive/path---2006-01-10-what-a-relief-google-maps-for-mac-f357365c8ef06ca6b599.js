But their unusual business model (offer almost <em>everything</em> for free) means that they've been targeting the largest mass of computer users — Microsoft-bound users, that is. </p>\n<p>As (Open Source Journalist) <a href=\"http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/\">Glyn Moody </a>wrote recently:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"large\">Google's software is heavily weighted towards Microsoft Windows. Programs like Google Earth and Picasa are only available under Windows, and its latest, most ambitious foray, the Google Pack, is again only for Microsoft's operating system. This means that every time Google comes out with some really cool software, it is reinforcing Microsoft's hold on the desktop. Indeed, we are fast approaching the point where the absence of GNU/Linux versions of Google's programs are a major disincentive to adopt an open source desktop.</blockquote>\n<p>Glad to see that little bit of criticism go so out of date so quickly. Now, Google, a Linux release, please.</p>\n<p>Via: <a href=\"http://www.mcwetboy.net/maproom/2006/01/google_earth_for_mac_officially_released.phtml\">The Map Room: Google Earth for Mac Officially Released</a></p>\n<p>Key system requirements: OS X 10.4 (Tiger), a 400-MHz processor, and 16 MB of video RAM, minimum — essentially, even a G3 iBook from mid-2002 should be able to handle it — but they recommend more than 1.5 GHz, 32 megs of video and a fairly speedy broadband connection.
