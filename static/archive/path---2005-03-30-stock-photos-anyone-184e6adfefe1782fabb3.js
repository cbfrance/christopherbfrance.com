If your organization doesn\'t have a large budget for that kind of thing (stock photos are $50-$250, usually), there are a few alternatives with a decent selection â€” and the pictures are only a few bucks, if not free.</p>\n<p>The best of these new, inexpensive resources is called iStock Photo. Prices are about $2, depending on the resolution you need. They have the best selection of people-pics, which are more expensive because of the model releases required. Their photos come in three sizes: those that are suitable for the web, those for small print, and high-resolution images for large-format printing jobs. www.istock.com</p>\n<p>Another good one is the Stock Exchange, which is actually free. They have fewer pictures of people, fewer high-quality pictures and no ability to choose lower resolution. But it\'s free, so start your search there. <a href="http://www.sxc.hu">http://www.sxc.hu</a></p>\n<p>Another free one is the Morgue File, a "public image reference archive." Lots of old newspaper pictures that have entered the public domain. Occasionally you will find what you need here, but it doesn\'t have a great selection. www.morguefile.com</p>\n<p>For more interesting backgrounds and textures and artsy work, visit: <a href="http://www.imageafter.com/">http://www.imageafter.com/</a></p>\n<p>If you really need a good picture invest in something from www.corbis.com</p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"March 30, 2005",path:"/2005/03/30/stock-photos-anyone",title:"Stock Photos Anyone?",tags:["stock","photography"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
