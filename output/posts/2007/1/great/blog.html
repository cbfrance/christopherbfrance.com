              This is such a fantastic blog that I had to point it out.  His description of our role (as consumers) in a technological world (online) is just refreshing. I've quoted a bit here from his <a href="http://ideant.typepad.com/ideant/2003/08/index.html">first month of posting</a>. I went back and found his first post, and I'm trying to digest all three years of his writing. At least it is Sunday.
