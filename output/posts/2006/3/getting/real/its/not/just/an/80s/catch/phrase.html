              It's a very '06 catch phrase. 
              
              My favorite non-open-source <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">software company</a> published a book today, and I think it's likely that it will do quite well. Considering the fact that they practically have their little Web-2.0 paws up the proverbial skirt of every well-intended, moleskine-toting geek in the blogosphere ... I think the fact that they're asking $20 for a PDF will be looked upon as a delightful novelty.
              
              <img src='/wp-content/uploads/hackersPainters.jpg' alt='Paul Graham' />I mean, I love campfire and all, but you could've at least published with <a href="http://www.Lulu.com">Lulu.com</a>.  Call me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crufty">crufty </a>bibliophile, but this doesn't seem like a great advance for D.I.Y. publishing. 
              
              After, the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">real barons of dot com</a> publish all their writing online <em>and </em> get a hardcover book deal from O'Reilly.
