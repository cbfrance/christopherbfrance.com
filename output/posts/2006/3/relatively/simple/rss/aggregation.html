              I recently posted about my need for a simpler RSS aggregator. 
              
              I worked through the massive list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_aggregators">existing RSS aggregators</a> at wikipedia and couldn't reallly find something that did exactly what I wanted and worked. 
              
              I needed something that was simple, cached hourly, displayed various encodings well and worked with RSS and Atom formats. Most importantly, I wanted something I could install on my own server, and it needed to be community oriented (not designed for a single reader).
              
              Most of the existing solutions on the web are hosted by a third party, and are limited in the number of feeds that they can aggregate. 
              
              A robust, simple option for a thrid-party hosted aggregator is <a href="http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/feed/">Feed2JS</a>, but if you want a bunch of feeds on your site you'll have to use a bit of javascript for each one. Multiple feeds get ugly fast, and if their server goes down, your scripts go down.  
              
              The best hosted solution I found was <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarius</a>, which has a lovely community. I think that gregarious will take the cake sometime this year as aggregating catches on. For now, however, the plugins are pretty limited -- you are locked into a personal reader with "Read/Unread" tagging. (Which makes Gregarious a great replacement for a newsreader like Bloglines, but it's not good for a community aggregator where lots of people visit.)
              
              If I were a better person I'd just write a Gregarius plugin, but instead I've just reworked some of Feed2JS's code (which is in turn dependent on the Magpie RSS parser.)
              
              <strike>You can download it <a href="http://www.nonprofitdesign.org/downloads/simple-aggregator.zip">here</a>. </strike>
              
              It's a index.php file with an "admin" folder. Drop it on your server in an appropriate directory and you should have a page that displays 15 biofuels blogs. NOTE: if you don't know what php is or don't have ftp access to your server, just use <a href="http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/feed/">Feed2JS</a> and insert their javascript into your page. 
              
              Otherwise edit the php file with the rss or atom feeds you want to include. It will probably need a little CSS to spice things up. You can send comments or questions about the script to chris(at)nonprofitdesign.org. I'll release another version sometime soon with better documentation and a prettier front end. 
              
              An example of the styled script in action is <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/aggregator/">here</a> (at the <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/">Piedmont Biofuels </a>website). 
              
              UPDATE: That page now uses <a href="http://simplepie.org/">simplepie</a>, which kicks ass.
