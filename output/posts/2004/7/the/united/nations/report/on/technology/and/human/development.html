              Here's a great PDF version of a slightly dated -- but far-seeing -- report from the UN on the uses of emerging technologies in human development. It's optimism is tempered with a good deal of experience -- it is clear that there is no single, technological solution to the problems of extreme poverty and inequality. Rather, technology is presented as being a key aspect of contemporary international development scholarship and praxis. This perspective, combined with their appreciation of the multitude of ways that technology is manifest, makes it an extremely worthwhile read.

              Technology networks are transforming the traditional map of development, expanding people's horizons and creating the potential to realize in a decade progress that required generations in the past."
