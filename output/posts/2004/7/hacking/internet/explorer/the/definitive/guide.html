              Well, this is perhaps not a definitive guide, but a good one nonetheless. I like his method of including the CSS link in the commented rule, and I appreciate his concern that IE7 (the next release of IE) will have bugs resolved -- making the hacks a problem.

              <blockquote class="large">
              The summary of our latest project client-side development brought to conclusion that thereâ€š"are are really just a few essential Internet Explorer hacks. By careful structure planning, I managed to stripe down all hackery to a much less additional rules. Since they are promising IE7 some time soon, more and more I think about secure CSS hacking. We surely don't want our sites to be a mess in IE7 for it's quite possibly half-repaired CSS support.
