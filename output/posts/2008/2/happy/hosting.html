              If you need a professional application server, particularly for rails, I'm recommending <a href="http://rimuhosting.com/">Rimuhost</a> these days. 
              
              Their VPS plans are a reasonable deal, but, as always, the support is what is always most important when choosing a host unless it's a super small static site, in which case the big guys like mediatemple, dreamhost, bluehost are fine. (Oh and check wordpress.com if you need a free site.)
              
              Just now I've been getting really clear, friendly, (and super fast) support from Brandon at Rimuhost, and he showed me a great trick for removing a password from a ssl cert: 
              
              <code>&#x000A;cd /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl && mv sitename.com.key sitename.com.key.with_password&#x000A;openssl rsa -in sitename.com.key.with_password -out sitename.com.key</code>
              
              Previously one of their techs was chatting to me well into the evening about a SQL issue I was having, free of charge, <em>after he got off of work</em>, just cause he was cool. and I love their VPS control panel, which lets you reboot, power down, and upgrade your RAM/HDD on the fly.
              
              If you need a development and production box, they will clone your production VPS (for free), in under an hour. Fastest demo box I've ever set up!
