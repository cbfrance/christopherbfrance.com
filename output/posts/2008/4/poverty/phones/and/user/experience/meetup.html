              Just a quick open invitation, if you are in San Francisco this weekend: 
              
              <strong>UPDATE: Changed the time to 4pm. </strong>
              
              I'm meeting with designer-researchers Niti Bahn and Dave Tait on <strong>Saturday, April 19th, at <strike>6pm</strike> 4pm</strong> at <a href="http://www.atlascafe.net">Atlas Cafe</a> in San Francisco (in the Mission). Come have a beer with us! We're talking generally about designing and researching technologies for the poorest people in the world (the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_of_the_Pyramid">bottom of the pyramid</a>"). Africa, Asia, mobile phones, sustainable change, environmental technologies, research methodologies, product design, application development, user experience ... lots of stuff. 
              
              Niti is a researcher, strategist and international rock star; Dave is an award-winning product designer and researcher based in South Africa. Developing world cell phone geeks, too. Check out this article they co-authored for a feel for what they are into: <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/featured_items/design_for_the_next_billion_customers_by_niti_bhan_and_dave_tait_9368.asp">Design for the Next Billion Customers</a>. 
              
              If you're interested, email me, or just show up!
              
              <strong>Oh and, we're doing some planning for a BarCamp unconference of the same themes this summer. Let me know if you would be interested in attending or supporting an event like that. Probably Late June or July.</strong>
