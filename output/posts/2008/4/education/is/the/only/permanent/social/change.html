              I've felt for a long time that education is the most important vehicle for social change. I mean, really how else does anything actually get done? You've got to have some kick ass teachers along the way, or you're gonna be a vegetable. And vegetabledom happens to entire societies. Watch out. 
              
              So I'm a little depressed that I don't get to work directly in the education sector anymore -- I used to have a great time working on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_evaluation">educational evaluation</a> projects, and for a time I was a mentor. Now I'm a full time geek staring at an LCD, and I don't so much ever get the thrill of seeing kids make the grand connections. (read: manipulating young minds, bwah ha ha.) 
              
              Anyway, just watched a great TED video from Dave Eggers. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/233">Give it 20 minutes</a> and tell me if you don't want to sign up to be a volunteer. It's a hilarious talk anyway, even if you hate kids.
