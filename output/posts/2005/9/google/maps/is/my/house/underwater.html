              Kathyn Cramer, based in New York, is doing great work with Google maps. The following information is quoted from <a href="http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/2005/09/how_to_find_out.html">her blog</a>. 
              
              Step 1: Go to Google Maps and enter the address. Click on the button that says "Hybrid" on the upper right. You will get an image with a speech ballon pointing to a thumbtack showing the location of the address on the satellite photo.
              [IMPORTANT UPDATE: Bless their hearts, Google Maps has added a "KATRINA" button to New Orleans areas searches, so they have automated some of the process I describe here! Yee haw!]
              
              Step 2: Click up and down the vertical ladder-like bar to see the image at various scales until you feel you can find the place on a satellite image.
              
              Step 3: Compare your image to this superimposition of the FEMA flood map on a New Orleans satellite photo, created by the Google Earth Current Events Community. Here is a small version. Click on it for a much bigger picture.
              
              <img alt="nola_fema_floodmap.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/nola_fema_floodmap.jpg" width="400" height="334" />
              
              If the address you are checking is fairly centrally located, you can also check your address image against the DigitalGlobe satellite picture of the flooding.
