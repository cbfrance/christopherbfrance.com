              While poking around on stuff related to the WSIS in Tunis, I found this excellent document about wireless internet in Africa, which was used at the first meeting of the WSIS in 2003. I only wish that there was an updated copy somewhere ...
              
              <blockquote class="large"><p>"The most intriguing application [of wireless technology] in developing nations is the deployment of low-cost broadband Internet infrastructure and last-mile distribution.</p>
              <p>The rationale for such interest is simple in theory: The digital divide cannot be resolved any time soon because of the prohibitive cost of deploying conventional wired infrastructure in developing countries. <b>Wireless Internet, however, has the potential to solve this bottleneck</b>, as the collection of articles and case studies in this volume demonstrates. ...</p>
              
              <p>So, why should this topic become central to the World Summit on Information Society initiative? First, wireless Internet may be a very effective and inexpensive connectivity tool, but <b>it does not carry any magic in itself</b>. It can only be successfully deployed as demand for connectivity and bandwidth emerges in support of relevant applications for the populations served. These may be supporting e-government, e-education, e-health, e-business or e-agriculture applications. But those are not easily implemented in the developing world. They do suggest that wireless Internet can indeed be <b>sustainably</b> and in some cases profitably deployed in support of economic and social development objectives in developing countries.
              </p></blockquote>
              
              <p>The greatest aspect of this document is that it represents how often the most successful cases of adoption is grassroots and local -- this type of development does not work well when it is imposed by some NGO or corporation.
              </p>
