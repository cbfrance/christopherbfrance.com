              Here's a chart of evaluation software packages form the Evaluator's exchange. The list is untested by yours truly, but the Evaluation Exchange (From the <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/hfrp/index.html">Harvard Family Research Project</a>) is an excellent resource for folks working with children. 
              
              Here's a bit from the article, the chart is about a 60K PDF. 
              
              <blockquote class="large"> 
              
              A wide variety of software packages are available to help nonprofit organizations track program management data and outcome measures for evaluation. One advantage of an "off-the-shelf" package is that these packages are often "tried and true." Another is that the software makers often supply training and technical assistance to users. On the other hand, organizations should carefully consider whether the available packages are appropriate for their needs. In some cases, organizations may find it more useful to design their own tracking systems, although the process can be time-consuming and may require extensive technical training.
