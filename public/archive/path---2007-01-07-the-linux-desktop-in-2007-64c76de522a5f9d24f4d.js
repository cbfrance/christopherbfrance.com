In spite of a few hiccups in some communities, and the astonishing lack of penetration into the mainstream brain, it is obvious that we are seeing more and more people getting it. </p>\n<p>Just check out IBM\'s <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/linux/integration/">Linux praise page</a> if you want an overview. And governments are getting it too, in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/01/14/korea_migrates_120k_civil_servants/">Korea</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-08-30-011-26-NW-LL-PB">Venuzela</a>, and <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=138464">India</a>.

You think of viruses ... Linux and Solaris prove to be a lot less headaches than any other platform. <span class="attribution">Amy Niersbach, Chicago geek-honcho</span></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, it is a bunch of elitist BS to pretend that the only reason people don\'t "get" desktop Linux is because they are just ignorant — Linux is hard. Switching is hard-ish. </p>\n<p>These governments are not doing something that is totally obvious — they are, but contrast, pioneers, and they are taking no small risk in putting Linux desktops in front of their municipal employees. I mean, really, I just can\'t see <em>my</em> Dad using ifconfig to fiddle with his network settings. Only recently has Linux distributions emerged that I would consider suggesting to my family, much less my family\'s coworkers. </p>\n<p>(By contrast, of course, Linux as a <em>server</em> platform has had success for so long, and open source software is <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">clearly dominant</a> on the server.)</p>\n<p>Ever since the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> campaign began a couple years ago, we have all seen how much it makes sense (in terms of attracting an audience) to focus on getting things to Just Work on a <em>personal computer</em>. Ubuntu has ridden the hype skyrocket right past Debian and Suse etc ... well, because they have a millionaire at the wheel ... but also because they have taken on the closed-source OS\'s head-on with regard to <em>usability.</em> They put a lot of time into making a Linux distribution that would recognize your iPod (and monitor and printer and keyboard ...) the first time you plugged it in. They even have a branch devoted to a kid-friendly version, <a href="http://www.edubuntu.org/">edubuntu</a>. And they have done a <a href="http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2006/01/01/breezy">lot of steady work</a> to make a more useable experience generally (even if they aren\'t rewriting the Gnome desktop). I think their <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">whole approach</a> deserves applause, despite all the remaining gotchas of linux. (Certainly there is not a Linux desktop the tops the Mac OS usability experience, in my opinion.)</p>\n<p>Related reading on usability:</p>\n<p>Check out the recent preview of the <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2007/01/sneek-preview-of-expected-features-in.html">KDE desktop</a>, which has been designed by a <a href="http://www.oxygen-icons.org/">wonderfully talented, small team</a>.</p>\n<p>And then there is the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000762.html">fascinating approach</a> to the UI taken by the $100 Laptop folks.</p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"January 07, 2007",path:"/2007/01/07/the-linux-desktop-in-2007",title:"The Linux Desktop in 2007",tags:["linux","desktop","ubuntu","education","usability"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
