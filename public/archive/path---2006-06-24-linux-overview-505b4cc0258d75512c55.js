Linus had an interest in Minix, a small UNIX system, and decided to develop a system that exceeded the Minix standards. He began his work in 1991 when he released version 0.02 and worked steadily until 1994 when version 1.0 of the Linux Kernel was released. The kernel, at the heart of all Linux systems, is developed and released under the GNU General Public License and its source code is freely available to everyone. It is this kernel that forms the base around which a Linux operating system is developed. There are now literally hundreds of companies and organisations and an equal number of individuals that have released their own versions of operating systems based on the Linux kernel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you are new to Linux, this may help to explain a lot of the confusion in your head about the numerous versions of the platform. </p>\n<p><a href="http://linux.wordpress.com/2006/06/24/linux-the-choice-is-there/">http://linux.wordpress.com/2006/06/24/linux-the-choice-is-there/</a></p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"June 24, 2006",path:"/2006/06/24/linux-overview",title:"Linux Overview",tags:["linux","tutorial"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
