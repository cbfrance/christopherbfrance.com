I figured that this would be a good-spirited critical discussion about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">FOSS</a> philosophy given that <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009063026788/Business/Google-meeting-held-at-Royal-University.html">Google was in town</a>. :) I wasn\'t expecting it to be quite so engaging for the lab though — I think they all had a great time. </p>\n<img src="/static/images/picture-24-300x223.jpg" alt="taking_notes" title="taking_notes" />\n<img src="/static/images/picture-23-225x300.jpg" alt="smilin" title="smilin" />\n<p>We did an introductory <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_party">mapping party</a> and I explained some of my appreciation for OSM, particularly the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Palestine_Gaza">Gaza mapping</a> that happened early this year.</p>\n<p>I am an OSM newbie myself so I was just happy that we managed to get everything working end to end (using GPS devices kindly loaned by the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Foundation">OSM Foundation</a> — thanks <a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/">Mikel</a>!) Also thanks to <a href="http://thinkwhere.wordpress.com/">Chippy</a> for leading the OSM session last month that answered my questions about the OSM toolchain and gave me the idea for doing an intro party in Phonm Penh.
