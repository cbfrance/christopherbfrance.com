Engelbart and the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) at Stanford Research Institute staged a 90-minute public multimedia demonstration at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. It was the world debut of personal and interactive computing: for the first time, the public saw a computer mouse, which controlled a networked computer system to demonstrate hypertext linking, real-time text editing, multiple windows with flexible view control, cathode display tubes, and shared-screen teleconferencing.\n<p>It changed what is possible. The 1968 demo presaged many of the technologies we use today, from personal computing to social networking. The demo embodied Doug Engelbart\'s vision of solving humanity\'s most important problems by using computers to improve communication and collaboration.</blockquote></p>\n<p><a href="http://stanfordtickets.org/tickets/calendar/view.aspx?id=2324">In the Bay?
