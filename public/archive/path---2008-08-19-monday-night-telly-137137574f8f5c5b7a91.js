(And redefined "sketching.") 1.5 hr. lecture. Teaser: includes the phrase "Charlton Heston flying through the air." Oh and also please buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371">Sketching User Experiences</a>. Operators are standing by. </p>\n<p>For the type nerds: <a href="http://typeculture.com/academic_resource/movies/">Erik Speikermann is my idea of what real men are like.</a> The opening jingle made me shoot beer through my nose. 6 minutes. Just watch it. Check out his <a href="http://www.spiekermann.com/mten/index.html">blog</a> too. </p>\n<p>For Architecture Geeks: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8639555925486210852">Stewart Brand</a> is brilliant and insane. Fun SF footage too.

(Bonus points if you know Stewart Brand\'s connection.) Long and really boring honestly. Use <a href="http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/1968Demo.html">this</a> like TV Guide, but watch the video on Youtube.
