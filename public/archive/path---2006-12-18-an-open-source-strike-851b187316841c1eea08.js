Some even demanded that Towns be removed as leader because he supported Dunc-Tank. Their objection was that by financially supporting developers, Debian would become a two-class system and that, in turn, would be destructive to the Debian community.</blockquote>\nLinux-watch.com just posted <a href="http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS3128387759.html">this article</a> commenting on recent delays in the much-loved <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> distribution of Linux. Interesting to note some of the internal politics on an open source project. I have to respect the developer\'s (reported) concern that the new pay structure at Debian might create a kind of class system on the project. So to me it makes sense the developers might stop contributing their time if something starts to smell bad in the project, but I haven\'t ever seen a "strike" called quite like this as the article suggests. I might be inclined to chalk this one up to something other than pure politics, anyway.
