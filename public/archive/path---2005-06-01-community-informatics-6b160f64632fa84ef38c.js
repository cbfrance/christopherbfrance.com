CI seeks to work with communities towards the effective use of ICTs to improve their processes, achieve their objectives, overcome the "digital divides" that exist both within and between communities, and empower communities and citizens in the range of areas of ICT application including for health, cultural production, civic management, e-governance among others. The Journal of Community Informatics brings together a global range of academics, CI practitioners and national and multi-lateral policy makers. Each issue of the Journal of Community Informatics will contain double blind peer-reviewed research articles as well as commentaries by leading CI practitioners and policy makers.</p>\n</blockquote>',frontmatter:{created_at:"June 01, 2005",path:"/2005/06/01/community-informatics",title:"Community Informatics",tags:["journal","academic"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
