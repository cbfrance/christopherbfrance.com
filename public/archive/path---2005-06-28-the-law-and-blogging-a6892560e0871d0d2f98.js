But it is good to know, for example, that if you quote someone saying something slanderous, you can be legally tried for libel, which is, in fact, worse. (Libel is printed, slander spoken.)</p>\n<p>As they are quick to point out: "None of this should stop you from blogging. Freedom of speech is the foundation of a functioning democracy ..."

The difference between you and the reporter at your local newspaper is that in many cases, you may not have the benefit of training or resources to help you determine whether what you\'re doing is legal. And on top of that, sometimes knowing the law doesn\'t help - in many cases it was written for traditional journalists, and the courts haven\'t yet decided how it applies to bloggers."</blockquote>\n<p>Get it: <a href="http://www.eff.org/bloggers/lg/">EFF: Legal Guide for Bloggers</a></p>\n<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>',frontmatter:{created_at:"June 28, 2005",path:"/2005/06/28/the-law-and-blogging",title:"The Law and Blogging",tags:["blogging","law","EFF"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
