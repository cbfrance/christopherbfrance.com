These are mostly intended to "collect natural resource information about fish and wildlife species and sensitive riparian, fresh water and marine habitats." </p>\n<p>It\'s a Canadian grassroots effort, and it\'s a wonderful thing to see. I especially like their broader mission to empower communities environmentally: </p>\n<blockquote class="large">Mapping typically takes place in rural and urban areas to assist planning sustainable communities and should also be used as a vehicle for empowering community conservation and stewardship of natural resources."</blockquote>\n<p>I love this site and their model (although some of their Macromedia ColdFusion mapping applications didn\'t work on my computer.)</p>\n<p>I believe that this type of project might be feasible for other types of community projects or collaboratives. Perhaps GPS cellphones and some server-side GIS could make a popular urban system investigating, perhaps, an environmental justice problem.</p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"January 03, 2006",path:"/2006/01/03/community-mapping-network-cmn",title:"Community Mapping Network (CMN)",tags:["geo"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
