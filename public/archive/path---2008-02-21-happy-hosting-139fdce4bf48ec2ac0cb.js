(Oh and check wordpress.com if you need a free site.)</p>\n<p>Just now I\'ve been getting really clear, friendly, (and super fast) support from Brandon at Rimuhost, and he showed me a great trick for removing a password from a ssl cert: </p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">cd</span> /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token function">mv</span> sitename.com.key sitename.com.key.with_password\nopenssl rsa -in sitename.com.key.with_password -out sitename.com.key</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Previously one of their techs was chatting to me well into the evening about a SQL issue I was having, free of charge, <em>after he got off of work</em>, just cause he was cool. and I love their VPS control panel, which lets you reboot, power down, and upgrade your RAM/HDD on the fly.</p>\n<p>If you need a development and production box, they will clone your production VPS (for free), in under an hour. Fastest demo box I\'ve ever set up!</p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"February 21, 2008",path:"/2008/02/21/happy-hosting",title:"Happy Hosting ",tags:["ops","rimuhosting"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
