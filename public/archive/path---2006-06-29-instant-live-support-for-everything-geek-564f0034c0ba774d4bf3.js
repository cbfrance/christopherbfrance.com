It was an obscure subject, but I needed generalized advice, so I didn\'t have a listserv (such as a particular software group) to turn to immediately. I was able to connect to a geek in a few minutes and have, basically, a web-based IM chat. Highly recommended if you need computer-related advice. I think there were probably only a few people online that I would have trusted as experts in this particular field, but hell, that\'s pretty great considering it\'s alpha. I hope the service grows. God bless the web. </p>',frontmatter:{created_at:"June 29, 2006",path:"/2006/06/29/instant-live-support-for-everything-geek",title:"Instant Live Support for Everything Geek",tags:["servicedesign","chat","im","interaction","ixd"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
