The major problems with this first version (using just the Magpie class) is the inconsistent treatment of the posts — some appear and some don't — and the improper encoding of the blogs. (I went 'round and 'round with the encoding. It's a common problem, but I couldn't get those damn posts clean.) Probably a few days in the <a href=\\\"http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=9384589&forum_id=12796\\\">Magpie listserv archives</a> at Sourceforge would clear all of this up ... but the archives are exceptionally annoying, the Magpie blog is down, and <a href=\\\"http://www.nonprofitdesign.org/biofuels/news/biofuels-aggregator1.php\\\">the first version</a> was still surprisingly slow anyway, even with the cache working.</p>\\n<p>So I found another solution, Alan Levine's <a href=\\\"http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/feed/\\\">Feed to JS</a>, which is built on Magpie.

I felt sure this would make it to slow to be usable, but I think (hope) I was wrong, even with 25 blogs on the same page.
