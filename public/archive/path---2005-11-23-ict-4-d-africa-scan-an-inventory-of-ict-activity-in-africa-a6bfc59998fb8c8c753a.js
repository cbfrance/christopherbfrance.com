It takes as its starting point a representative sample of funding institutions and maps their ICT4D programs and initiatives in Africa against a backdrop of countries, regions and themes. It also makes an attempt to identify the organisations with which these development institutions partner, and in what areas these partnerships occur.\n<p>The result is currently not a comprehensive inventory, but an illustration of the potential of using geographic, thematic and partnership information to not only provide an inventory or a snapshot of ICT4D activity in Africa, but to begin to see trends in terms of emerging themes, in terms of countries and regions of specialisation, in terms of partnerships, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\nVisit: <a href="http://open.bellanet.org/afscan/index.php">ICT4D Africa Scan</a>',frontmatter:{created_at:"November 23, 2005",path:"/2005/11/23/ict4d-africa-scan-an-inventory-of-ict-activity-in-africa",title:"ICT4D Africa Scan: An Inventory of ICT Activity in Africa",tags:["research","ict4d"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
