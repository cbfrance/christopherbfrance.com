Sorry for the lack of post in the last month. We've had several large projects at Nonprofitdesign.org, and (more relevantly) I've had a major database snafu. I'm switching to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, an elegant, open source platform based on php. I should've done it a long time ago.
