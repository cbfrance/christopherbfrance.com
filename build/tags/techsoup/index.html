      <p>This post from Tech Soup is a good, brief introduction to the use of databases in your organization.</p>

<p>The author of this article (a nice techie from ONE/Northwest) finds that you should really call in the professional to get things set up &mdash; I would agree, but don&#39;t let that keep you from learning how to use it.</p>

<p>A database is an investment of time that can really pay off, especially if you have been managing your donor lists, inventory, etc. by hand. But that means you need to know how to use it. </p>

<p>Make sure to check the entire selection of articles about <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/howto/articles.cfm?topicid=6&topic=Databases&cg=nav&sg=database">nonprofit databases at Tech Soup. </a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit from the overview: <blockquote class="large">While it&#39;s no simple task, developing a basic Web site made up of pages of text and images is usually a job that can be taken on by the staff of a nonprofit organization, hopefully with a little help from a professional designer who can aid in the development of the site&#39;s look and feel. Implementing advanced features on your site, however, will most likely require a level of expertise that doesn&#39;t make sense for your organization to internalize. The goal of this article is to explain the benefits of database-driven Web pages as well as the possibilities and vocabulary involved to help you make informed decisions.</blockquote></p>

      <p>Techsoup just announced that they have Symantec Antivirus with multiple user licenses for under $100. (Single user licenses start at $100.) If you haven&#39;t priced antivirus software, well, that&#39;s a bad sign. Unless your&#39;e on a Mac, but that&#39;s a different post. </p>

<p>Bottom line is that you shouldn&#39;t be paying anything near full price for software if you have 501(c)3 status to flash. Check out the other stuff they have, most notably Alpha 5 (PC Magazines &quot;best database&quot; of the year), Macromedia Contribute 3 (excellent cheap way to run your website) and Dreamweaver (great web development environment). They also have Microsoft and Cisco software for a pittance. </p>

<p>Check it out under the Techsoup Stock tab at the top of their page:

      <h2><a href="/2005/05/05/what-the-hell-is-rss/">What The Hell Is RSS?</a> </h2>

      <p>There&#39;s a good discussion going on now at <a href="http://www.techsoup.org">TechSoup </a>about how you can use technology to increase capacity of your nonprofit. </p>

<p>Their latest focus is on RSS, which is one of the more amazing technical innovations of modern communications. If you don&#39;t know what RSS is, you&#39;re not in the loop.</p>

<p>Most notably, you are missing two things. 1.) The ability to prrocess inhuman amounts of information on a regular basis. RSS is used by many sites to create &quot;digests&quot; of (a.k.a. &quot;syndicate&quot;) their content. News sites, for example, offer these RSS &quot;feeds&quot; to sections of their newspaper. </p>

<blockquote>It's a lot like having a TiVO for your favorite sites.</blockquote>

<p>Once you subscribe to one, it appears in your RSS reader of choice. In the end, it&#39;s a lot like having a TiVO for your favorite sites &mdash; every time you sit down and you want to read, you have a list of updated articles in front of you. No wasting your life poking around the less glamorous parts of a newspaper page. </p>

<p>2.) If you have a website that is updated regularly, you can create a RSS feed so that others can subscribe to your page. This may seem a little superfluous if you don&#39;t even know what a RSS feed is. &quot;Who would use it?&quot; Plenty of folks will, especially over the next year or two. So start writing some engaging articles for your site. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit from the Tech Soup conversation:</p>

<blockquote class="large">"If you're like most people who use the Internet, chances are you often come across new and interesting sites, but then completely forget to visit them again. Or likely you spend too much time visiting the same sites looking for new information, only to be disappointed. 

In addition, your e-mail inbox is probably flooded with messages you barely have time to read, including subscriptions to newsletters that tell you about new content available on still more Web sites. ... Wouldn't it be nice if there were an easy way to have all this information come to you and go to them in a way that was easy to manage, timely, and put the reader in control? "</blockquote>
