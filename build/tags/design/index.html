      <span class='timestamp'> 
        Sep 26 2009
      </span>
      <p>Some time ago, I joined Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/unthinkingly">@unthinkingly</a>, and I loved it. Then, something felt wrong, and I deleted a bunch of followers. First I went down to 200 people, then 100, then 50, and it still was <strong>somehow wrong</strong>, so I quietly slipped out the door. Nobody really complained. I think many people have experience this burnout. Twitter is kinda hard. There&#39;s just so much happening. To me, what was exciting became overwhelming. Serendipity curdled into distraction. </p>

<p>When I left I was incredibly relieved. I could stop listening and start kicking ass.</p>

<p>So, I took a break, moved away from the ever-intense San Francisco bubble, worked in Cambodia, wrote a bunch of code ... and now, hey look! I&#39;m back on Twitter. But, just to confuse you, I&#39;ve setup not one but <strong>two Twitter accounts</strong>: the old <a href="http://twitter.com/unthinkingly">@unthinkingly</a> is back for professional stuff, and now <a href="http://twitter.com/cgblow">@cgblow</a> for more private personal observations.</p>

<p>Turns out, it&#39;s such a simple and healthy solution; I don&#39;t know why more people don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s not a complicated hack or anything, you just have to use a separate email account. (A tool like <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/" title="Seesmic: Build Your Community">Seesmic Desktop</a> lets you stay signed into both at the same time.)</p>

<p>Now, please don&#39;t misundersand me: I strongly believe in living a principled, genuine life. Naive as it sounds, I try to never ever say anything that I would not say to someone&#39;s face. Life is too hard that way. I&#39;m an incompetent liar. I don&#39;t maintain multiple personalities &mdash; I have a single, genuine and faceted personality. Just like most people I know.</p>

<h3>Back in the Day</h3>

<p>As an application designer, I keep spotting architectures that expect, and in some cases force, me to have a single, monolithic expression of my personality. I take offense to this because we, as humans, are all multi-faceted. We speak to our parents differently than our coworkers. We lower our voices a bit in a crowded coffee shop. We stand up straighter when we give a presentation. And, again, these are not about secrecy or duplicity, but rather, indications of maturity, and a uniquely human sophistication.</p>

<p>Back in the day, we did this better, probably by accident. We didn&#39;t have ways to prevent you from creating multiple accounts. We didn&#39;t really need to &mdash; there were no zombie spammers. From an application design perspective, the geography was totally different because of this difference. We had tiny little awesome communities. Your importance was judged more by what you said than how many &quot;friends&quot; you had. </p>

<p>Back in the day, you were expected to have a short pseudonym, a handle, that you could use (or not use) across any bulliten board you wanted. And on IRC in particular, you can (still!) register dozens of pseudonyms if you wanted to, and express yourself appropriately in different contexts. You can whisper, lurk and rant, all at the same time. Just like you can in real life. </p>

<h3>The Test</h3>

<p>In thinking this through, I realized that the most irritating thing wasn&#39;t really about the information overload thing. That&#39;s still there.</p>

<p>What I found on Twitter, the way I was using it, was a lack of trust. And, get this, &mdash; not other people trusting me, but me actually trusting <strong>my own network</strong>.</p>

<p>So, I created a test for <a href="http://twitter.com/cgblow">@cgblow</a>. In order to set the bar a little higher, and really give myself a break from some of these frustrations, I have simple, but hardcore, criteria for who I&#39;ll follow with @cgblow: <strong>I could give you the root password to my computer</strong>. In fact, I&#39;ll Twitter it right now. Done.</p>

<p>How much do you really trust your network? What can you say, and what is off limits because you have to say it to <strong>everyone</strong>? How does a sprawling, Facebook-style personality portal limit your experience of genuine community? How much do you trust your own network?</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/05/07/swift/">Swift</a> </h2>
      <span class='timestamp'> 
        May  7 2009
      </span>
      <p>For the last 5 months I&#39;ve been working with friends at <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> and <a href="http://meedan.net">Meedan</a> on a project nicknamed &quot;Swift.&quot;</p>

<p>Our goal with Swift is to provide a crowdsourcing platform for &quot;data triage.&quot; Imagine something like Mechanical Turk used only for tagging news, photos, microblogging and videos. There&#39;s no business model or anything like that &mdash; it&#39;s strictly Open Source Nonprofity Goodness(tm). Meedan and Ushahidi are partners in hacking it out.</p>

<p>As a user of Swift you can sit down at an &quot;assembly line&quot; of news and tag it. Swift gives you a straightforward aggregator for news (say, news about earthquakes in california) then asks you to tag all of the people, places and organizations in that firehose of data. With a little bit of effort (collecting a few rss feeds and marking up all the content) it becomes possible to put a very bright light on an emerging part of the web. You can, for example, tag violations of electoral code in an election, as we are doing with <a href="http://votereport.in">Vote Report India</a>, which uses Ushahidi and Wordpress as a platform for grassroots reporting in the month-long Indian election. </p>

<p>I&#39;m especially interested in knowing how much we can actually <em>do</em> with the public data that emerges in realtime during a crisis. From a journalistic perspective, it seems like there is an opportunity to understand more concretely <strong>what the hell is going on</strong>.</p>

<p>For Ushahidi, Swift is an extension of their exisiting SMS reporting cycle. By &quot;listening&quot; to the &quot;outside&quot; web in a more structured way, the hope is that we can provide more relevant alerts to people on the ground in a crisis. </p>

<p>For Meedan, Swift is a tool for a team of editors who need to produce interesting content for their digital newsroom. Because it is an aggregator, Swift serves naturally as a listening post as well as a tagging workbench. Rope in a few feeds (such as <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=election">Twitter search results feed for &quot;election&quot; </a>) and then do location extraction for the Middle East with <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">Calais</a> on that feed, and you have a pretty cool stream of entities.</p>

<p>Today we had a great meeting at InSTEDD, with a crazy good crowd of people &mdash; everybody was in town for the <a href="http://hrc.berkeley.edu/events/newmachineconference/">conference at Berkeley</a>. Thanks to everyone for their ideas and support!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my presentation from today:</p>

<p>[<a href="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=dashboardshort-090507011606-phpapp02&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=swift-update-may-6">http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=dashboardshort-090507011606-phpapp02&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=swift-update-may-6</a>]</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/unthinkingly">http://www.slideshare.net/unthinkingly</a>]</p>

<p>All of the photos and links can be found on <a href="http://flickr.com/unthinkingly">my Flickr page</a>.</p>

<p>Swift seeks to publish all of the entities that concerned communities publish about crisis, both hot flash and slow burn events. The core use case is for the period immediately following a disaster or crisis, during the hours and days of confusion. </p>

<blockquote><ul><li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/swiftriver">The Swift Mailing List</a> </li>
    <li><a href="http://swiftapp.pbwiki.com/">The Wiki</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://github.com/ajturner/swiftriver/tree/master">github repo</a></li> </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that is always interesting about Swift is that it is a very unusual use case. The tragedy of a crisis creates a temporary period of great social empathy during which many &quot;rules&quot; of interaction design break down. This is a design opportunity. Many people are willing to match their #have to someone else&#39;s #need, but they don&#39;t have a medium for volunteering, or a network of supporters who can contextualize and respect their work. We just watch CNN and feel powerless; we would love a way to help, as an individual, from across the world. An improved marketplace of volunteerism is possible if we can design the appropriate interactions.</p>

<blockquote>
On December 9, 1968, Dr. Douglas C. Engelbart and the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) at Stanford Research Institute staged a 90-minute public multimedia demonstration at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. It was the world debut of personal and interactive computing: for the first time, the public saw a computer mouse, which controlled a networked computer system to demonstrate hypertext linking, real-time text editing, multiple windows with flexible view control, cathode display tubes, and shared-screen teleconferencing.

It changed what is possible. The 1968 demo presaged many of the technologies we use today, from personal computing to social networking. The demo embodied Doug Engelbart's vision of solving humanity's most important problems by using computers to improve communication and collaboration.</blockquote>

<p>Just found out about <a href="http://livelabs.com/blog/keeping-current-with-political-streams/">Political Streams</a>.</p>

<p>I really do like this idea, but reinventing the pie chart with those desaturated squares is not a good start. I&#39;ll be checking it out to see how they iterate on representing the concept, which is fascinating.</p>

<blockquote>It mines information from all the blogs and Web sites out there, and all on one screen, lets you see the relative popularity of any given story, whether it's trending up or down, and tracks the number of mentions of the people and places mentioned in the story. </blockquote>

<p>The graphs, by contrast are wonderful and straightforward:</p>

<p><img src="/images/sstreams_new_2.jpg" alt=" " title="sstreams_new_2" /></p>

<p>oh and cf. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/blews/blews.aspx">Microsoft Blews (TM)</a> which has similar data (and infoviz problems). </p>

<blockquote>While typical news-aggregation sites do a good job of clustering news stories according to topic, they leave the reader without information about which stories figure prominently in political discourse. BLEWS uses political blogs to categorize news stories according to their reception in the conservative and liberal blogospheres. It visualizes information about which stories are linked to from conservative and liberal blogs, and it indicates the level of emotional charge in the discussion of the news story or topic at hand in both political camps. BLEWS also offers a 'see the view from the other side' functionality, enabling a reader to compare different views on the same story from different sides of the political spectrum. BLEWS achieves this goal by digesting and analyzing a real-time feed of political-blog posts provided by the Live Labs Social Media platform, adding both link analysis and text analysis of the blog posts.</blockquote>

      </span>
      <p>Update: The Ushahidi team has released a strong new open source iOS codebase. </p>

<p>After a few months of work, we have gotten a new wireframe of the mobile app running on the iPhone. </p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/images/buttons/ushahidi_button4_170.gif">http://www.ushahidi.com/images/buttons/ushahidi_button4_170.gif</a> &quot;Ushahidi: Crowdsourcing Crisis Information&quot;] </p>

<p>Lately I&#39;ve been volunteering a little bit for <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a>. Ushahidi is an open source tool for monitoring crises and disasters. It recently won the the <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2008/05/30/winning-the-netsquared-challenge/">NetSquared challenge</a> and was called one of the top startups to watch in the MIT Technology Review. Man, I really don&#39;t have to give up anything to work on this one &mdash; it&#39;s really a top notch operation going on. Other nonprofit and open source teams could learn a lot from the Ushahidi project. </p>

<p>Some of the amazing things about the Ushahidi project include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Participatory design. Everyone is invited to comment on these designs and <a href="/ushahidi/Ushahidi_v3b.psd">hack on the psd files we created</a>.</li>

    <li>Rapid prototyping. (Really rapid: the first version of the app was built in a weekend.)</li>

    <li>The application is completely open source. </li>

    <li>It's a platform, not a web application: you can get the code and extend it for your own uses.</li>

    <li>Strong user-centered design principles.</li>

    <li>Great attention to detail in the design and insistence on top-notch interfaces (including the marketing website and the admin pages of the application).</li>

</ul>

<p>Anyway here&#39;s the latest mockup. Here&#39;s the latest<a href="/ushahidi/Ushahidi_v3b.psd">source PSD</a>. It&#39;s v0.2 and still has a long way to go. We did the iPhone app first and will be using lessons learned from this one to port the project to other platforms. </p>

<p>[<a href="http://whiteafrican.com/images/ushahidi_iphone_v02a-500x310.jpg">http://whiteafrican.com/images/ushahidi_iphone_v02a-500x310.jpg</a>]</p>

<p>I did most of the sketching and developed the concepts that were flying around, and then my man Joe Jones did all the real work in Photoshop. It&#39;s been a really fun time so far and I am looking forward to implementing some of the changes being discussed on the <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi blog</a>.  </p>

      <p>Today Adaptive Path, the godfather company of the interface and experience research industry, released the first of some amazingly high quality <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/aurora/">concept videos</a> about the web browser of the future. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really impressed, even though I spent most of the day grousing about some of the details of the interface they showed &mdash; my nitpicking is really just evidence of how much detail there is in the video.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the real importance of the videos is not specific to any of the UI details &mdash; it&#39;s about what&#39;s happening at Mozilla, and the new inclusive approach they are taking to visual and experience design. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t put it better than <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2008/08/04/open-source-design/">Dan Harrelson did this week</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Joining an open source software project usually requires one thing: the ability to cut code. If you live in the world of functions, methods, Git, SVN, and SQL, you'll find many a friend in open source. If you instead work with Photoshop, wireframes, sketches, and stickies, you'll find it is a bit of a challenge to join an open source project. The community of developers has a history of shunning anyone who is a not programmer. Plus, open source software projects are not heavily promoted in the design community.</blockquote>

<p>UPDATE: My buddy <a href="http://hook.org/">Andy</a> pointed me to the <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-the-concept-series-call-for-participation/">Mozilla call for participation</a>, which does a great job of summarizing the initiative. </p>

<blockquote>Today we're calling on industry, higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the Web. <strong>You don't have to be a software engineer to get involved</strong>, and you don't have to program. Everyone is welcome to participate.</blockquote>

<p>The wacky bike was designed by IDEO people &mdash; I&#39;m also impressed with their recent riff on the magazine quiz (maybe think madlibs): A Rockefeller sponsored <a href="https://client.ideo.com/socialimpact/">guide to creating social impact</a> with your design firm. </p>

<p>And the App: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/">FrontlineSMS</a> is a thoroughly wonderful idea in many ways ... I mean, if you&#39;re into international rural research with mobile phones. A tool worth watching very closely, it&#39;s what I think is the leading platform of the mobile research &quot;industry&quot;. (if there is such a thing.)</p>

<p>They just released a major new milestone and have bunch of great new branding. Great work, <a href="http://www.blogspot.kiwanja.net/">Ken</a>!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple of the best bits. </p>

<p>Oh, and it&#39;s all about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile programming</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design">Interaction Design</a>. If you don&#39;t care about such things then this is all really boring probably. </p>

<p>It might be boring regardless. </p>

<blockquote class="long">When an architect begins to define a building, he or she works very closely with the people who are buying the building to understand what the requirements are, and translate those requirements into a sketch of a solution. Then there's a lot of give-and-take between the occupants of the building and the architect in coming up with a viable solution. Usually, the architect at the sketch level will know enough not to design something that's an engineering problem. 

And if the architect does detect that there might be problems, he or she will consult with an engineer to make sure that he or she is not painting himself into a corner, technically speaking. At a certain point, the architect and the customer are going to achieve common ground. At that point, the architect turns those sketches into detailed drawings. Now, during the detailed-drawing phase, there's a lot more intense interaction between the architect and the engineer. The architect, you know, draws a span and calls in the engineer and says, how big a girder do I need to support this span? And there's a lot of detailed interaction between the two. <strong>This is precisely what happens in the world of good interaction design. </strong>

<blockquote class="long">I think XP has some really deep, deep tacit assumptions going on, and I think the deepest tacit assumption is that we have a significant organizational problem, but we can't fix the organization. Essentially, the crap rolls downhill and ends up rolling right into the programmer's lap. When the product or the program turns out to be unsatisfactory, the fingers point to the programmer. <strong>XP is very well-intentioned; it's the software-development community beginning to say, "Hey, this is not only unfair to us, but it's not productive as a discipline and we can do a lot better."</strong> </blockquote>

<blockquote class="long">"I applaud that sentiment and I agree with that sentiment, but then XP says, "OK, so, I can't change the organizational failings, so, I'm going to build my own internal defenses." I suppose this is probably better than nothing, but I'm interested in changing the way organizations are constructed. <strong>I believe that in order to create quality software, you have to change the organization.</strong> We can change the organization, and it strikes me that the assumption underlying XP is that the organization's structure is a given."</blockquote>

<blockquote class="long">
Building software isn't like slapping a shack together; it's more like building a 50-story office building or a giant dam.

Beck: I think it's nothing like those. If you build a skyscraper 50 stories high, you can't decide at that point, oh, we need another 50 stories and go jack it all up and put in a bigger foundation.

Cooper: That's precisely my point.

Beck: But in the software world, that's daily business.

Cooper: That's pissing money away and leaving scar tissue.

<p>Just a quick open invitation, if you are in San Francisco this weekend: </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Changed the time to 4pm. </strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m meeting with designer-researchers Niti Bahn and Dave Tait on <strong>Saturday, April 19th, at <strike>6pm</strike> 4pm</strong> at <a href="http://www.atlascafe.net">Atlas Cafe</a> in San Francisco (in the Mission). Come have a beer with us! We&#39;re talking generally about designing and researching technologies for the poorest people in the world (the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_of_the_Pyramid">bottom of the pyramid</a>&quot;). Africa, Asia, mobile phones, sustainable change, environmental technologies, research methodologies, product design, application development, user experience ... lots of stuff. </p>

<p>Niti is a researcher, strategist and international rock star; Dave is an award-winning product designer and researcher based in South Africa. Developing world cell phone geeks, too. Check out this article they co-authored for a feel for what they are into: <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/featured_items/design_for_the_next_billion_customers_by_niti_bhan_and_dave_tait_9368.asp">Design for the Next Billion Customers</a>. </p>

      <p>So I went to this Street Hacks talk 2 nights ago is here: <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/ "><a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/">http://www.janchipchase.com/</a> </a> (it was awesome, you missed it. Clam Pizza.) And then it turns out Chipchase just got all famous this week, <em>seriously</em>: First a rad <a href="http://audiovideo.economist.com/?fr_chl=8094fc97a897f95d4bf846ee51a4214809017977">video in the Economist</a>.</p>

<p>And then <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html?pagewanted=1">in the New York Times</a>. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my Reader&#39;s Digest version, since I know you are graphing how much time you spend on blogs. </p>

<p><strong>About Chipchase, who really is a super-nice guy:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="long">
"To an outsider, the job can seem decidedly oblique. <strong>His mission, broadly defined, is to peer into the lives of other people, accumulating as much knowledge as possible about human behavior so that he can feed helpful bits of information back to the company, to the squads of designers and technologists and marketing people who may never have set foot in a Vietnamese barbershop </strong>but who would appreciate it greatly if that barber someday were to buy a Nokia. ... </blockquote>

<p><strong>About getting over your hatred of your cellphone (cursed device efficiency-obsession). This bit hit a nerve for me:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="long">Understanding [stuff] requires forgetting for a moment about your own love-hate relationship with your cellphone, or iPhone, or BlackBerry. Something that's mostly a convenience booster for those of us with a full complement of technology at our disposal &mdash; land-lines, Internet connections, TVs, cars  can be a life-saver to someone with fewer ways to access information. ... Jan Chipchase and his user-research colleagues at Nokia can rattle off example upon example of the cellphone's ability to increase people's productivity and well-being, mostly because of the simple fact that they can be reached. There's the live-in housekeeper in China who was more or less an indentured servant until she got a cellphone so that new customers could call and book her services. Or the porter who spent his days hanging around outside of department stores and construction sites hoping to be hired to carry other people's loads but now, with a cellphone, can go only where the jobs are. <strong>Having a call-back number, Chipchase likes to say, is having a fixed identity point, which, inside of populations that are constantly on the move displaced by war, floods, drought or faltering economies</strong>  can be immensely valuable both as a means of keeping in touch with home communities and as a business tool.</blockquote>

<p><strong>On the incredible value that can be provided by something so simple, like SMS: </strong></p>

<blockquote class="long">"... public health workers in South Africa now send text messages to tuberculosis patients with reminders to take their medication. In Kenya, people can use S.M.S. to ask anonymous questions about culturally taboo subjects like AIDS, breast cancer and sexually transmitted diseases, receiving prompt answers from health experts for no charge.</blockquote>

<p><strong>On Microfinance and the bottom of the Pyramid:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="long">
... A cellphone in the hands of an Indian fisherman who uses it to grow his business which presumably gives him more resources to feed, clothe, educate and safeguard his family  represents a textbook case of bottom-up economic development, a way of empowering individuals by encouraging entrepreneurship as opposed to more traditional top-down approaches in which aid money must filter through a bureaucratic chain before reaching its beneficiaries, who by virtue of the process are rendered passive recipients.</blockquote>

        Apr 11 2008
      </span>
      <p>I&#39;ve recently been reading quite a bit about &quot;personal metrics&quot; (aka &quot;attention data&quot;, aka your &quot;information wake&quot;). Pictured are some examples from <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>, <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/">Nike+</a> and <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> (which I used for a few days this week! My Saturday computing is visualized below.)</p>

<p>As an infoviz junkie, I have to say that I have always <em>adored</em> this stuff.<strong> But the tonight I heard a very smart person say that, prior to Nike+, collaborative running was impossible.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/picture-2.jpg" alt='nike+' /></p>

<p><img src="/images/lastfm.jpg" alt='LastFM data' /></p>

<p><img src="/images/rescutime.jpg" alt='Rescuetime' /></p>

<p>Wait, really? How did we get to the point that we need a website, an RFID chip, and an iPod to coordinate running with friends? </p>

<p>And, perhaps more importantly, when did we start to forget it was possible otherwise?</p>

<p>Information visualization of this kind exudes authority and direction &mdash; it gives you clear goals, measurable output, definitive results. It facilitates competition, reward, efficiency and progress. Sexy, sure. But so does fascism.</p>

<p>In these graphs, I see a kind of quiet aplomb that says, &quot;look, buddy, this infoviz shit clearly says that I know <em>so bloody much</em> about what I&#39;m doing, and it&#39;s very likely that I&#39;m doing it all twice as well as you are, sub-aware urchin.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s indeed an <a href="http://www.peterme.com/?p=646">air of inevitability</a> about it all, but why? </p>

<p>Is it inevitable that, <em>just because it is possible</em>, that we must practice <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/sousveillance/">self-surveillance</a>? </p>

<p>Are we really doing it for ourselves, as a form of personal empowerment? When I use <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> to track what I listen to, <strong>how much more do I become socially self-conscious</strong>, using my playlist for competitive leverage among my peers? Can I become more socially invested in the metrics than emotionally invested in the music?</p>

<p>When I use RescueTime to track everything I do on my computer, how much more efficiency-oriented and self-conscious do I become? <strong>Can I become more passionate about my productivity than my job?</strong></p>

<p>And with Nike+, does my daily run become more compelling just because it is more competitive and metrics based? <strong>Can I love the satisfaction of the graph more than the outdoors?
</strong>
Is it possible to be satisfied by the graphs alone? Is it possible to be more concerned with your attention data than to the stuff you&#39;re actually paying attention to?</p>

      </span>
      <p>If there is anything I hate more than cell phones, it&#39;s money. </p>

<p>I mean, of course everybody <em>likes</em> money, but seriously, who wants to actually deal with it? Going to the bank, cutting checks to the landlord, saving receipts, budgeting, negotiating salaries, calculating the tip, trying to find stuff on sale, thinking about taxes ... man, I have <strong>so</strong> many more interesting things to do. It&#39;s all just exhausting, if you ask me.</p>

<p>But. As usual. I&#39;m griping. </p>

<blockquote>Imagine a world without access to banks and the services they provide - baseline services such as credit, money transfers, savings. For many of the world's poor this is the everyday reality and it's a space where in part due to the spread of mobile telephony there are disruptions and innovations.<span class="attribution">- <a href="http://futureperfect.com">Jan Chipchase</a></span></blockquote>

<p>So, ok, reality check. When it comes down to it: A) Thank Allah I&#39;ve got enough to live on and B) Thank Jesus that I have some sort of infrastructure to deal with it in the first place. <strong>As in &mdash; literally &mdash; I&#39;m thankful that I have a bank, and receipts and all that crufty stuff that makes it all actually work.</strong> </p>

<p>Because a hell of a lot of people don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s Chipchase on it earlier this week: &quot;Imagine a world without access to banks and the services they provide - baseline services such as credit, money transfers, savings. For many of the world&#39;s poor this is the everyday reality and it&#39;s a space where in part due to the spread of mobile telephony there are disruptions and innovations.&quot;</p>

<p>And, Hey! Look! there they go again, those damned Cellphones! :)</p>

<p>Since this money stuff seems to have some potential influence on the future (who knew!), I&#39;m actually really <strong>excited to be heading to <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBankSF">BarCampBank</a> San Francisco next weekend, to talk about cell phones and money</strong>. With a bunch of finance geeks.  The point of this unconference is to dig into some of the newest, craziest ideas in finance technology, to &quot;foster innovations and the creation of new business models in the world of banking and finance.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping for some discussions about peer-to-peer lending a long with a bunch of talk about the future of mobile currency exchange. In general I&#39;m hoping that there are some folks there who really grok the reality that mobile phones are the most important platform for application development in the developing world. </p>

<p>In this context, I don&#39;t care about iPhones, I don&#39;t care about web apps; I&#39;m talking about paying your rent via SMS. I&#39;m talking about currencies and payment methods that aren&#39;t defined by a government or even a bank! </p>

<p>Or something. This stuff is all so crazy I get the feeling nobody really knows what&#39;s obviously essential vs. obviously stupid as hell.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I hope it will be a good conference that gets to some of the more important ICT4D issues. You really never know with unconferences. If we all want to talk about Baudrillard and Obama, that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do. (They&#39;re exciting that way. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll lead a session on user-centered design, like I know anything. It would be better than the Baudrillard and Obama session at least.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s to some exciting innovation at BarCampBank on Saturday ... maybe I&#39;ll see you there.</p>

        Feb 20 2008
      </span>
      <p>Things are looking great so far with this hairbrained project of ours. </p>

<p>Fabulous, actually: <a href="http://boltpeters.com">Bolt | Peters </a>is super interested in the project and wants me to work on it for some percent of my total time at work. Which is fan-freaking-tastic! Thanks BP!</p>

<p>If you have no idea what I am talking about, check out my <a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/2008/01/02/kestrel-a-simple-web-app-for-community-supported-agriculture/">last post about it</a>. </p>

<p><strong>But, in short, these are the three things that I love about Kestrel already:</strong></p>

<p>Kestrel is a web application for farmers.
Kestrel is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design">participatory design</a> project.
Kestrel is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> project. 
Kestrel is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design">user-centered</a> project. (Deeply so; as in, we won&#39;t build it if it doesn&#39;t solve real-people problems.)</p>

<p>Ok that was four. Anyway, I&#39;ve gotten so much great feedback already by email phone and comment &mdash; and I am now setting up interview dates. <strong>Let me know if you would like to talk on the phone for about an hour.</strong> We&#39;ll be gathering feedback about the initial concept and looking at some first drafts of first drafts. Basically, we&#39;re gabbing on the phone for a bit and I&#39;m taking some notes. </p>

<p><strong>You can participate in a number of ways: </strong></p>

<ul><li>Giving feedback based on your professional experience (as a farmer, user researcher, designer, guru ...) </li>
<li>Giving feedback based on your experience with other applications for famers. </li>
<li>Giving feedback as a CSA manager, owner, or eater. </li>
<li>Giving feedback as one of my parents, friends or online weakly linked nodes.</li>
<li>Etc.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Please leave a comment or email me at unthinkingly at gmail if you want to participate.</strong> You know you wanna. Research is fun! </p>

<p>We&#39;re conducting real live conversations, not just email exchanges, <em>though email is also a great way to give feedback</em>. Also, note that, as much as possible, we&#39;ll be recording interviews; part of the point of this project is that the methodology will be completely documented. We record stuff partly just part of the public nature of participatory design, partly because we want to get as much informed criticism as possible, but also because we want to teach other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">communities of practice</a> to create a web app!</p>

<p>Dammit, if we (as a very small, active team) can build something that work really well for 50 farmers, then we probably have created something that will work really well for 50,000 farmers. </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://truefood.wordpress.com/">tes</a>, Andrea, <a href="http://becktench.com/">Beck</a>, <a href="http://chathammarketplace.coop/">Mary</a>, Chris R., <a href="http://www.rickbradley.com/">Rick</a>, <a href="http://ideacog.net/">Ben</a>, Mike, Nate and <a href="http://www.storytreefarm.com/">Anne</a> for commenting already on the previous post; we already have strong support in San Francisco, Portland and Central NC.</p>

      <span class='timestamp'> 
        Jan  3 2008
      </span>
      <p>I&#39;m just getting started on a new project nicknamed Kestrel. </p>

<p>The basic idea a simple and user-centered web app that helps facilitate ordering, billing and member management for CSA&#39;s. Things are JUST getting started and I am soliciting help in doing some feasibility research as well as a basic evaluation of existing CSA management applications. </p>

<blockquote> 
A CSA, (for Community Supported Agriculture) is a way for the food buying public to create a relationship with a farm and to receive a weekly basket of produce. By making a financial commitment to a farm, people become "members" (or "shareholders," or "subscribers") of the CSA. <span class="attribution"><a href="http://www.localharvest.org/csa/">Local Harvest</a></span>
</blockquote>

<p>So far were in stage zero: Over the holidays I was brainstorming with some of my agri-geek friends in North Carolina, notably <a href="http://truefood.wordpress.com/">tes thraves</a>. (I like to say that tes is to poverty + agriculture issues as Jay-Z is to hip-hop &mdash; a badass producer who just makes things happen.)  :) So far there&#39;s been a lot of excitement about it from both consumers and producers. 
<ul>
<li>Stage zero is lots of talk over drinks around the New Year&#39;s bonfire, basically. Check.
</li>
<li>Stage one is research about what real CSA&#39;s need. 
</li>
<li>Stage two is getting a few CSA&#39;s to pilot test a first iteration for a season. 
</li>
<li>The rest is iterating and improving based on real feedback. This is the hard part. And the fun part.
</li></p>

<p>The only real spec so far is an application that is incredibly simple and driven purely by a real understanding of the users&#39; needs.</p>

<p>There is no timeframe yet. I imagine things could take a year or so; nobody&#39;s getting paid by Kestrel. </p>

<p>Codewise, I&#39;ve done some simple scaffolding of the application, but really I think the requirements for this type of thing are simple &mdash; the codebase is not really the issue. Just a few forms, login/out and billing. So I&#39;m not looking for help from coders as much as I am trying to garner some interest from A) the users of the application, farmers and consumers and B) people with experience in user-centered application design and user testing.</p>

<p>The goal is a management tool that would simplify the process of ordering food from your CSA, but also serve as an educational model of CSA best practices. </p>

<p>Right now I&#39;m thinking a hosted solution, almost certainly built in Rails. And of course completely Open and Free.</p>

<p><strong>The basic use case comes from my mom</strong> : she doesn&#39;t like very much lettuce in her box. Last year she got six heads of lettuce at a time. So ideally mom could just login and set her preference, pay her bill, update her address, give notice that she&#39;s out of town for a month, etc. The farmer then knows exactly how many heads of lettuce to harvest, and can keep the rest in the ground until going to the market on Saturday. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a new idea, I know. There are several in San Francisco. I haven&#39;t seen them yet. But I am sure that they&#39;re not as good as they can be and I want to put the users at the front of developing a new open source solution.</p>

<p>CSA&#39;s are great for environmental, social and economic reasons. And they&#39;re really just a lot of freaking fun. So if you are a consumer or producer with opinions about what you&#39;d like to see in this type of software, let me know in the comments or unthinkingly-at-gmail.com. </p>

      <span class='timestamp'> 
        Jun 18 2007
      </span>
      <p>Recently I&#39;ve been really worked up about all these computers in the closet. It&#39;s a bunch of junk. </p>

<p><img src='/images/picture-4.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Monitors in the office. Akk.' /></p>

<p>A bunch of dot-com-bubble bullshit that never needed to be purchased in the first place.  I&#39;ve been stressed out about that festering backwater of old computers since I got my job here 16 months ago.</p>

<p>For 16 months, I worried that it would all be super expensive to recycle.</p>

<p>For 16 months, I worried that it wouldn&#39;t be recyclable at all.</p>

<p><img src='/images/picture-1.jpg' alt='More crapola.' />  </p>

<p>I worried because it was all crappy Pentium II processors and Pre-OSX Apples and janky Sun workstations. Stuff our design and programming team would <strong>never</strong> touch (nose upturned). Not to mention the 105-pound rack-mounted servers. All of it full of toxic heavy metals. Not to mention the steaming pile of three button Sun mice and a giant nest of serial cables. And the 39 (!) keyboards.</p>

<p>Seriously, this stuff has been sitting around for years. It obviously must be some sort of corporate psychic baggage. Worse, I&#39;ll bet most everyone reading this blog also has some secret e-waste laying around. We&#39;re a web design shop, but every office I&#39;ve ever worked in has at least one generation of &#39;puters laying around.</p>

<p>Taking a clue from <a href="http://ecoiron.blogspot.com">Ecoiron</a>, a great blog of green hardware issues, recently bought the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Made-Break-Technology-Obsolescence-America/dp/product-description/0674022033">Made to Break: Technology and Obsolescence in America</a> by historian Giles Slade. It has been pretty great so far, mostly string of amusing primary sources.</p>

<blockquote>
    "Americans threw out 315 million computers in 2004, and 100 million cell phones in 2005. Most were still usable, and all contain permanent biological toxins (PBTs). Electronic trash, or e-waste, is rapidly becoming a catastrophic problem. To understand how we ended up in this alarming predicament, Slade recounts the fascinating history of American consumer culture and the engineering of our "throw-away ethic."
    <span class="attribution">- Booklist on <em>Made To Break</em></span>
</blockquote>

<p><img src='/images/slade.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Made_to_break' /></p>

<p>Perhaps a real review will be in order if I ever actually read the entire thing, which is rare these days. For now perhaps I will just note that this book was one of the primary reasons for <a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/2007/06/15/genocide-vs-gadgets/">not getting an iPhone</a>. One less Blackberry that has to die in a desk drawer.</p>

<p>Anyway, about all those computers in the office. I was really just nervous about taking it all to the dump and feeling like a complete earth rapist or something.</p>

<p>But in the end, what did it take to get rid of them?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out, not a three-day excursion to the landfill. And we didn&#39;t have to participate in some ill-conceived plot to ship it all to the developing world.</p>

<p>We just took pictures and listed it on  Craigslist.</p>

<p><strong>And 90% of it was gone in 24 hours. To people who were <em>delighted</em> to have it. </strong></p>

<p>The moral of the story: give it away now. Even if you think it is too old to use, give it away. And then think twice about that new gadget. There is joy to be had in your ewaste. Reuse is cathartic.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen gadget hype reach the levels that have been achieved by the iPhone. And I&#39;ve never been so caught up in it myself. After visiting <a href="http://www.eyesondarfur.org/">eyesondarfur.org</a> I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m giving my iPhone budget to <a href="http://www.eyesondarfur.org/">Amnesty International</a>: $50 a month over the next year.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming">culture jamming</a> spirit I spliced an iPhone ad into one of the arresting images from the book <a href="https://secure3.ctsg.com/amnestyusa/store/viewProduct.asp?cookietest=1&From=%2Famnestyusa%2Fstore%2FviewProduct%2Easp&Product=600&CategoryName=New+Products&CategoryId=11">Darfur: Twenty Years of War and Genocide in Sudan</a>. I&#39;m not anti-iPhone in particular: I just want to remind folks (<em>especially</em> myself) that there are more important things to focus on than the gadgets being thrust in your face. </p>

<p>If you have the luxury of a budget for consumer electronics, why not consider putting just a percentage of it toward something like an anti-genocide campaign? </p>

      <h2><a href="/2007/05/13/wanted-an-open-source-user-centered-touchscreen-platform/">Wanted: An open-source, user-centered touchscreen platform</a> </h2>
      <span class='timestamp'> 
        May 13 2007
      </span>
      <p>There has been a lot of excitement recently around a couple of developments in touch screen interfaces:  First there was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcKqyn-gUbY&mode=related&search=">insane presentation at TED 2006</a>. Secondly, of course, the iPhone made everyone all hot in the pants for it&#39;s touchable goodness.</p>

<blockquote> In Malawi, the NGO <a href="http://www.baobabhealth.org/">Baobab Health Partnership </a>... adapted Linux to $100 touchscreen Internet appliances, then wrote a program for Opera to run in full-screen kiosk mode. The resulting terminal can easily manage the nation's health data and is scalable wherever a web connection can be made.
<span class="attribution"><a href="http://www.vestaldesign.com/blog/2007/03/malawi-linux-the-fight-against-hiv.html">J. Goodman at Vestal</a></span></blockquote>

<p>Fundamentally I think that <em>touch</em> is intimate and intuitive, and clearly touchable interfaces have incredible potential, especially for the folks that haven&#39;t been brow-beaten into adapting to 20th-century conventions of computer interfaces like the QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<p>(i.e., the billions of people that will be introduced to &quot;desktop&quot; computing the next decade. See the OLPC, <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/wiki/Current_events">just launched for reals in Uruguay</a>.)</p>

<p>So I&#39;m excited about a new project at work that involves designing a web application for use with a touch screen interface. When I first heard about it from the client I was coffee-though-the-nose excited because I have been infatuated by a recent project I read about on Vestal: <a href="http://www.vestaldesign.com/blog/2007/03/malawi-linux-the-fight-against-hiv.html">Malawi, Linux, &amp; The Fight Against HIV</a>. I knew immediately that I was going to rip off the idea. (In the best open source sense, of course.) </p>

<p><img src='/images/touchscreen.jpg' alt='Baobab clinic.' />Unfortunately the iOpener touchscreen used in the project is no longer for sale (it had a lovely $100-$200 price tag b/c it came with some money-making software &mdash; there&#39;s a funny story about the <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2000/03/34977"> linux hack</a>), so I was hoping someone might have some idea about how to implement this as cheaply as possible. </p>

<p>A few criteria: </p>

<ul>
    <li>As open-source as possible</li>
    <li>Durable</li>
    <li>Replicable</li>
    <li>Low Power</li>
    <li>Low CPU resources (The machine will be cheap, with flash memory, prob.)</li>
    <li>Beautiful (in a Platonic way <grin>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically I want to avoid wire splicing and flaky homegrown drivers in favor of something that is replicable and extremely flexible. I want to be able to develop a web application with an appropriate UI and let it rip. (Which will be greatly facilitated by the work of the Baobab programmers&#39; &quot;<a href="http://www.baobabhealth.org/2006/08/30/touchscreen-toolkit-documentation/">touchscreen toolkit</a>&quot;). This might not be easy given the limitations of cheap machines.  </p>

<p>So far I&#39;ve got an <a href="http://www.wdlsystems.com/modperl/view_services.cgi?r=detail&prod_num=1EBOX23&aisle_id=799">EboxPC</a> in the office (a nice, fanless machine with CF and VESA mounts for the back of the monitor) with some form of embedded Linux (we&#39;ve built a tiny Linux distro for our rural wireless network that might be usable if we can get the drivers to work with the touch screen). Looks like we can get screens for about $100 and then we&#39;ll have to put a touch screen on top. Regardless, this is still in the brainstorming phase, so that&#39;s all likely to go out the window.</p>

<p><strong>Anyway, what good is a touch screen like this? </strong></p>

<p>Well, combined with the right software, I think you can really leverage usability to do a hell of a lot:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make a huge impact in developing world healthcare like Baobab has done. </li>

    <li>Collect data easily from a kiosk at a disaster area.</li>

    <li>Setup a database-driven check-in desk at your next nonprofit conference.  </li>

    <li>Collect survey data remotely (anywhere in reach of the net).</li>

    <li>Setup a small store without an incredibly expensive, proprietary POS system. </li>

</ul>

<p>I think there are lots of possibilities given that the interface could just be so much more usable. Just looking into it briefly I found an <a href="http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg2003/0503_anderson.html">open source POS system for use in cooperative markets</a>. Brilliant. This is software that could really benefit from an inexpensive stable touchscreen implementation.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience or ideas? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be posting my findings here, along with the software design considerations that I run into. </p>

Minus points for O&#39;Reilly implying that this will lead to Web 2.0 apps that are constantly improving themselves based on user activity.

<p>The <a href="http://darfurwall.org/">Darfur Wall</a> is a beautifully executed charity project that fills a very simple, traditional purpose (collecting money) using an innovative and stark interface.

      <p>Great advice on crafting a home page from <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/homepagegoals">A List Apart</a>. In short: build it last, and work first on the details (the smallest, ubiquitous elements of your site). A great homepage with poor search results or product page will only lead to disappointment.  So if your site is shallow and ugly on the inside, make sure your homepage is too.   Also: </p>

<p>You enter a hex code value for a color, then another to mix it with, and out comes a beautiful png graphic of the color scheme. Extremely nice work, Steve. This is a great resource for brainstorming color schemes. I&#39;ve used a number of other methods, but this one gets the prize. </p>

<h3>UPDATE</h3>

<p>Ok, so the color palette generator at <a href="http://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/index-en.html">wellstyled </a>(shown)  is even better.<br>
I still recommend one extension of the techniques: take a scheme you like and use Photoshop to adjust the hue locally, and generate as many versions as you need (perhaps for clients or your boss). Then it&#39;s even easier to get ideas. If your&#39;e a new web designer, that&#39;s a good enough reason on its own to downlo ad a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/main.html">trial of Photoshop</a>, I think. </p>

      <p>Web Designers everywhere are taking a break. </p>

<p>Sometime about 5 years ago people began to realize the frustrating limits of web development because the existing standards were so poorly followed by existing browsers. It was something like what Frost said about &quot;poetry without rhyme is like playing tennis without a net.&quot; </p>

<p>Which is to say, no fun at all. Online communication has progressed steadily since then, and now we have wonderful fruits like &quot;AJAXy goodness&quot; and other Web 2.0 technologies to reap. So take a break from griping about Netscape vs. Internet Explorer. </p>

<p>But Google Maps (etc.) being accomplished, we&#39;re looking for ever greater technologies. The next frontier of web development is the mobile browser &mdash; the web in a cell phone. </p>

<p>The concept of the mobile web has been huge this year, and it is now taken as a fact that most internet users in the next 5 years will be getting online for the first time through their cell phones. </p>

<p>And so, with that in mind, here&#39;s a great series of articles from designer Cameron Moll that looks at the background of the mobile web and explores the specifics of developing +designing reliable, readable sites for really, really small screens. </p>

      <p>Here&#39;s an interesting feature from a nonprofit organization called the <a href="http://public.gov3.net/public_pages/limited/default.htm">gov3 Network</a>, which appears to be a kind of ICT government consultancy.

<p>Put a country and comparison region into this <a href="http://public.gov3.net/public_pages/limited/research/benchmarking/gov3_digital_dashboard.htm">Digital Dashboard</a>, and the result is a data-dense graph that is intended to give governments a sense of how quickly they are moving in the right (or wrong) direction for growing their tech sector. </p>

<p>I think this could be a useful tool, but I&#39;m wary of private organizations seeking (lobbying?) for &quot;more proper&quot; regulation of the ICT sector as being a thin veil for simply giving opportunity to industry, not people. That said, they have a stated interest in promoting &quot;a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society.Also, they&#39;ve recently won an award at WSIS for <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/Homepage/fs/en">DirectGov</a>, a website that brings together a mess of information about UK government services. </p>

This report reviews the evidence on how (or if) ICTs should be used in support of poverty reduction exercises.

There is one characteristic that is common to most of the ICT-related poverty alleviation programs. It finds that the most effective ICTs used are typically basic onesâ€š telephone and radio are most common, and when computers or the Internet are involved, they are for restricted, targeted uses.

It finds several common characteristics of successful projects:

    * the focus is on poverty alleviation and not on ICT use
    * ICT components are kept as simple as practical
    * ICT practitioners are involved in the design of the ICT components
    * there is significant community involvement
    * there is a focus on training to ensure success and sustainability
    * there is consideration of a plan for success; how to replicate and scale project if it is successful</blockquote>

I appreciate his skepticism about the project, especially his explicit reference to the late, not-so-great simputer idea, which bombed because of economics. </p>

<p>You know, that pesky money thing. Always a problem when dealing with poverty.</p></p>

<p>here&#39;s a bit: 
<blockquote class="money">
&quot;After peppering Negroponte with two hours of questions, I&rsquo;m fairly convinced that this laptop won&rsquo;t suffer the problems the Simputer did - I believe it will get produced and distributed and that the software will enable e-books, web browsing, word processing and programming. As much as I enjoy the geekery of challenging Negroponte and others on the fine points of hardware and software design for the developing world, I&rsquo;m convinced that some extremely smart people are working very hard on the hardware and software side of things. While I might question some of the decisions made, I don&rsquo;t know that my second-guessing is helpful at this point.</p>

      <p>I am currently researching a field of design known as &quot;Participatory Design&quot; that has a fascinating history (dealing with Scandinavian labor unions) and a very promising future. In short,  PD is about incorporating the user in the design process from day one. The resulting ideas and workflows are, in my mind, incredibly powerful tools for working on any project. My focus is web development. </p>

<p>Most of my interest in this concept comes from my day job at a nonprofit evaluation firm &mdash; we do &quot;collaborative evaluation&quot; to help programs develop. The concepts are largely the same, and I&#39;m just trying to apply them to web design and the development of usable, useful online tools.</p>

<p>This process is intimately involved with many of the same user-centered concerns that preoccupy other ICT-development folks, such as the advocates of free and open-source software. </p>

<p>The center of the world for PD is the organization <a href="

      <p>If you need to easily display slideshows online, there are a couple of options that I have recently run across. The simplest, though not as sophisticated, process is to use a site called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, which was recently acquired by Yahoo! and can be a lot of fun. You just upload your pictures and folks can link to them to form online picture-sharing communities. The best feature is that it can export to your blog or website, though the format is not as customizable as I&#39;d like.</p>

<p>The second, more complicated, option, is to go with javascript. For our purposes here, we&#39;ll assume you don&#39;t want to write a bunch of javascript yourself. Instead, <a href="http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/slideshow/">BarleyFitz</a> studio will take care of that. Just go there and upload your pictures on their site, and you&#39;ll get very straightforward instructions for inserting the resulting code in your site. Customization can make it look especially good (here&#39;s a fantastic <a href="http://randomhawk.com/stuff/randomhawk/final/">example</a> posted to a recent css forum. The fade in is especially nice). I have used BarleyFitz&#39;s javascript in some forprofit work with greta success, but is rather convoluted javascript in use, so be ready to sit down with it for a while if you want it to look really nice.</p>

<p>This type of slideshow would be good for nonprofits that need a way to showcase their activities on the web. There are other, more expensive solutions, but they are often overdesigned (with noises and animations at every click of the mouse).</p>

      <p>Stephen Pinker writes in his book How Minds Work that &quot;the emotions are mechanisms that set the brains highest-level goals.&quot; This, it seems, is a good description of why small, mission-driven nonprofits exist despite the innumerable difficulties of keeping such an operation afloat. It&#39;s also an essential idea to consider when advertising your organization.</p>

<p>People are drawn to imagery and emotions that inspire them to work for a cause. If you have ever been saddled with the task of creating ads or promotional material for your organization, you would do well to keep these emotions &mdash; not facts about your job or accomplishments &mdash; at the front of your mind.</p>

<p>This concept is just one idea among many in an immensely useful e-book published a couple of years ago by Cause Communications called <a href="http://www.agoodmanonline.com/pdf/bad_ads_low_res/BadAdsLo.pdf">Why Bad Ads Happen to Good Causes</a>. It should be in every nonprofit office (unless you have the luxury of an ad department to think about such things). It covers broad ideas like the above, but it also goes into detail about using layout and text to keep people reading and engaged in your message. And it has great reviews of nonprofit ads over the last 10 years. It is, in short, an eminently readable advertising textbook for nonprofits; check it out before your next ad deadline.</p>

      <p>Even if you&#39;re new to web design and Javascript spooks you, you&#39;d do well to look into some of the techniques that are described in the attached article. </p>

<p><a title="My Favorite Javascripts for Designers: Blakems.com" href="http://www.blakems.com/archives/000087.html">My Favorite Javascripts for Designers: Blakems.com </a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit of the article: 
<blockquote class="large">
Are there certain javascripts that you seem to always use from project to project? Lately, I have seen javascript being used more and more effectively on websites. For example, Gmail&#39;s user interface and Mike Davidson&#39;s sIFR technique. How we use javascript on a website can certainly make a website experience better and more enjoyable. I will never proclaim to be a javascript expert or even write javascript from the scratch. On the other hand, I do excel at the copy, paste, and tweak method.
