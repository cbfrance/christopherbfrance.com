      <p>Brian Russell of<a href="http://www.audioactivism.org/"> Audio Activism</a> is putting together (along with a bunch of help, I&#39;m sure he would modestly point out) the next Podcaster Conference in NC.  </p>

<p>I missed it last year, but I love the idea of a unconference:  &quot;The event <strong>will not </strong>have traditional speakers, commercial product pitches, or bags full of conference swag. The event <strong>will have</strong> free food and drink, pre-organized sessions, and will be conducted in an unconference style.&quot;</p>

<p>If you want to learn about the wonderful world of grassroots audio production and how it&#39;s getting along, then check it out and come un-network. </p>

<p>Where: 116 Murphey Hall, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC
When: Saturday, January 7, 2006 11am - 4pm
Register/Info:  <a href="http://www.podcastercon.org/">PodcasterCon.org</a></p>

      <p>Podcasting is not complicated. It's just audio. The problem lies in finding something worth listening to. 
</p>

<p>I subscribe to about a dozen podcasts, most of them technology-related, though some are about education or the media. (Technology-anything is always easy to find on the internet, naturally, because that's where the experts live.) Soon we'll have high-quality podcasts about a much broader range of subjects, and I expect that many of them will be coming from much smaller, more independent producers. Keep an eye on the podcast directories such as the one hosted at <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/">www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts</a>. For now, however, I must admit that &mdash; contrary to that maverick, grassroots image that hovers over podcasting &mdash; I listen to an awful lot of stuff from larger outlets like NPR and PBS. (I'm especially fond of <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/">On The Media</a> from NPR. Bob Garfield just cracks me up.)
</p>

<p>By the same token however, podcasts can help me tune into things on NPR that are well-produced, but have very limited distribution. I'm thinking of Christopher Lydon's <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/">Open Source</a>, which is an excellent liberal call-in show produced by WGBH. Lydon is just sharp, and he certainly has a great deal of experience running a radio program. I'm listening now, offline, as I write. Their format embraces the use of the internet by actively soliciting comments and ideas through the web, and they do it worldwide, often including perspectives from the people that they are talking about. A nice package that I'd other wise miss out on if I weren't a subscriber.   
</p>

<p>Other podcasts, like those of the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/series/bloggercon2004.html">Bloggercon</a> and <a href="http://www.poptech.org/">Pop!tech</a> conference series, attempt &mdash; in a wonderfully useful way &mdash; to reproduce and memorialize some of the ideas that get generated at these geek festivals. This has been an important way for me to have personally participated in conferences that I otherwise could not have afforded to attend (Pop!Tech was in Camden, Maine ... not an easy place to get to). Too bad the logistics of recording conferences are often fraught with recording problems. Audio is hard to do right. (Video, by the way, is a lot harder still, which makes me think that acceptably decent, small-scale videocasting is quite a ways off. Things change fast these days, though.)
</p>

<p>Still other podcasts are the work of real individuals, working in idiosyncratic ways to create something that's often highly personal. Often these remind me of the mid-1990s' heyday of personal webpages ... which means they're important but sometimes ugly. Some are just bad and ulgy. This is what I hope changes as things mature, as we head toward a sweet spot of podcasting content produced by small teams of people who really care and understand what they're talking about. Further still, I hope that we'll be seeing more and more podcasts that address issues at the intersection of society and technology in a progressive, thoughtful way. 
</p>

<p>That's why I was so excited to find this in my RSS aggregator today, from <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com">Ethan Zuckerman</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote class="large"><p>Tim Zak, the head of Pittsburg Social Enterprise Accelerator, has teamed up with Doug Kaye of IT Conversations to produce a new podcast series called &ldquo;Globeshakers&rdquo;, which features social innovators from around the world. They&rsquo;re off to a great start with interviews with Andrew Zolli (the curator of Pop!Tech), David Bornstein (an author and expert on social entrepreneurship)&#8230; and me.</p>

<p>Tim asked me to talk about my experiences with the Katrina Peoplefinder project and the larger issue of how the Open Source community responds to disasters. You can read more about the conversation, or just download and listen to it. Thanks, Tim, Doug and Peter Durand, for making this interview - and so many others - possible.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Hooray!</p>

      <p>Ever since the first Vatican broadcast of a sermon on the radio in 1931, there has been little doubt about the power of broadcast media as a part of religious practice. </p>

<p>Contemporary &quot;church-theatres&quot; (typically the kind with the lights and music shows) are taking the role of media much more seriously, and it appears that they&#39;re adapting to some of the most advanced uses of ICT in the world. In an article in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/technology/">today&#39;s New York Times</a>, it&#39;s noted that individual podcasts from sites like <a href="http://www.theatrechurch.com">theatrechurch.com</a> and <a href="http://www.godcast.com">godcast.com</a> are attracting thousands of subscribers worldwide. That&#39;s a number that&#39;s relatively unheard of at this point in the podcasting evolution.</p>

<p>What is happening is that these communities, already acclimated to the idea of technology-aided practices, are becoming heavily invested in using everything at their disposal to achieve their mission. </p>

<p>But I think the point in all this is more than just an impressive development in the religious sector. The willingness of religious groups to adapt to podcasting and other ICT-based forms of community practice means that this is viable &mdash; that this really works. Podcasting and blogging&#39;s implications have thus far been clear to a few geeks and technologists, but there is, at least among certain populations, a sense in which these religious communities are making it a reality.  </p>

<p>But if youre thinking of Pat Robertson televangelism, consider the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. </p>

<p>The marches, speeches, meetings of the Civil Rights activism of the 1950s and 1960s &mdash; that was what I would call a serious community. And much of it was deeply spiritual, coming from a critical Black religious movement. </p>

<p>There is much work to be done in revitalizing the religious fuel for the social justice fire, and, judging from the excitment generated by the current developments in worship, there may be a wealth of underdeveloped resources for doing so in the near future.  ###</p>

      <p>After getting back from a lecture at the most recent N-TEN Tech club meeting, I found myself enlightend as to the way of the podcast.</p>

<p>Brian Russell is a stand-up guy doing a lot of grunt work with the development of podcasting as a tool of activist. His website does a great job of explaining the current state of the field, and of course his podcast is great: </p>
