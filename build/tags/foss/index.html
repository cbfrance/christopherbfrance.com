      <p>I think that <a href="http://www.tuxmagazine.com/">Tux Magazine</a> started a couple of years ago. <blockquote class="large">For a number of reasons--not all financial--the model we had built for TUX was not sustainable. At this point, a group of us who were involved in TUX are tossing some ideas around. Where it will go we are not sure but let me assure you that enough of us feel TUX needs to exist that we will try our best to come up with, as they say, &quot;Plan B&quot;.</blockquote>Their goal was to server the &quot;new Linux user,&quot; with glossy color articles about installing the latest KDE, understanding the differences between the various distros, and getting your new printer to work with Ubuntu. </p>

<p>It was an interesting niche that seemed really promising. (Several other Liunx magazines exist, but are written more for the hardcore geeks.) </p>

<p>Alas, just before their 21st issue, they have just announced that they are closing down. </p>

<p>I wonder what this means for the state of the Open Source OS in 2007?</p>

      <h2><a href="/2006/12/06/167/">You Are The Enemy: "Information Rights" vs Open Source</a> </h2>
      <span class='timestamp'> 
        Dec  6 2006
      </span>
      <p>Ever since the introduction of Microsoft Office 2003 it has been possible to distribute documents that can only be used in the way that you want them to be used &mdash; such as limiting who can copy, print or forward the information. This type of control, however has been easy enough to defeat with a third party reader that ignores the &quot;Information Rights Management,&quot; which is really just a bunch of plain text XML, as <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196601781&amp;pgno=1&amp;queryText=" title="Cory Doctorow article at Information Week">Cory Doctorow explains at Information Week</a>. So IRM is really not about security in the first place. <blockquote>&quot;The current version of remote attestation facilitates the enforcement of policies against the wishes of computer owners. If the software you use is written with that goal in mind, the trusted computing architecture will not only protect data against intruders and viruses, but also against you. In effect, you, the computer owner, are treated as an adversary.&quot; 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Infrastructure/trusted_computing/20031001_tc.php" title="EFF link">-The E.F.F.&#39;s analysis on the new techniques</a></blockquote></p>

<p>Microsoft, naturally, would like to end the ability to use third-party readers like OpenOffice all together, and is working to develop an industry standard that will allow your motherboard to take digital signatures in order to prove that your software is not tampered with. Security is touted as being the reason for all the work, but it seems clear enough that a uber-vendor-lock-in is attractive to the Men of Microsoft.  </p>

<p>The Electronic Freedom Foundation has a typically <a href="http://www.eff.org/Infrastructure/trusted_computing/20031001_tc.php" title="EFF link">well-researched document</a> on the background of the situation, with some proposals for mitigating the vendor lock in issue.  </p>

      <h2><a href="/2006/01/25/great-podcast-jonathan-schwartz-the-participation-age/">Great Podcast: Jonathan Schwartz - The Participation Age</a> </h2>
      <span class='timestamp'> 
        Jan 25 2006
      </span>
      <p>I love this podcast (and I adore the entire IT Conversations series). Here&#39;s a link and a blurb. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail492.html">IT Conversations: Jonathan Schwartz - The Participation Age</a></p>

<blockquote class="large">
The free and open source software movement is moving, rapidly. The open sourcing of Solaris has added lent enormous weight to this community based development culture. The community behind free and open source software is changing the landscape of software development and moving the value away from traditional delivery of a piece of software. What is making such communities very successful? What obstacles do they face? And what should we all be doing to ensure continued success?

Jonathan Schwartz, President and COO, Sun Microsystems answers these questions and more in his keynote address at the OSB. Mr.Schwartz, one of the most high profile corporate bloggers around, goes back in time to show how standardization and access to communication has resulted in enormous all round economic growth. Starting with the standardization of canals and railroads dimensions to a standard voltage and plug form for electricity distribution he explains how industries have created new opportunities and moved on to deliver value in non-traditional ways.

He talks about how Thomas A. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb and holder of a few hundred patents, failed in trying to protect his Intellectual Property by trying to trash rivals and draws parallels to more recent efforts of companies which try to protect their IP and hypocritically participate in community development. You wouldn't expect Mr. Schwartz to defend FOSS in anything but the strongest terms and he delivers in a manner which will gladden the hearts of this increasingly visible community.</blockquote>
