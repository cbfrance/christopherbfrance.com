Most of the gang at <a href="http://boltpeters.com/">Bolt | Peters</a> went to <a href="http://www.baychi.org/">BayCHI</a> tonight, and I was really impressed by a presentation from Yahoo about <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/">BOSS (Build your Own Search Service)</a>. 

Turns out that, once you get beat badly by Google, you start to get really open. Nice.

Basically BOSS (bad name, great tool) means that, with a minimal contingency of programmers, you can get a completely custom search running, and apparently you can even manipulate the rankings algorithm. Currently Yahoo is running it without requiring ads or anything. Exciting. 

What a great way for a big conservative company to innovate -- just let hackers go to town on your fancy database and algorithms. I can't wait to see what comes out of it.
