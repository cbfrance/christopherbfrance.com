  <h2>Don't pitch me.</h2>
  <p>Last week I read this article on ReadWriteWeb that advises a startup to &quot;<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/03/give-it-to-them-straight-avoid-pitching-to-your-board.php">Give It to Them Straight: Avoid &quot;Pitching&quot; to Your Board</a>.&quot; The article explains how it can be bad to exaggerate your product and cover up problems that you are experiencing in development: </p>

<blockquote>
"VCs hear bad news all the time -- it is part of the startup process and part of the VC job description," says Hirshland. "Any VC worth his or her salt should respond to bad news, provided it is shared in a timely fashion, by helping the entrepreneur figure out the best way to respond rather than dwelling on what went wrong."
</blockquote>

<p>To which I must respond: no shit! We <strong>all</strong> hear bad news all the time. Get is straight, <strong>a &quot;pitch&quot; is a lie plus hubris</strong>. None of us want to be lied to. Would it be that hard to just tell everyone on your project the truth about what your software does and how the development process is going? </p>

<p>It&#39;s incredible to me that we have created a world in which this has to be pointed out: <strong>don&#39;t delude your closest supporters</strong>. It&#39;s indicative of the fact that developer culture has become the domain of hucksters and charlatans.  There is a deeply manipulative and delusional culture at work here, and let&#39;s be clear <strong>there is absolutely no room for it in nonprofit and humanitarian technology</strong>. </p>

<p>Read the language around a tech conference like <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/blog/">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, where hundreds of startups come to fetishize themselves as combatants on a &quot;startup battlefield.&quot; From their own words, it sounds like an joyous exercise in self-delusion:  &quot;It&#39;ll be a little bit like pitching a top VC, except it will be done live on stage in front of thousands.&quot; </p>

<p>Is it so crazy to imagine a conference where we are all honest about what our software actually does, and they types of frustrating issues that we are facing in development? Then we could join hands and sing songs, I guess. </p>

<p>It sounds unrealistic because, you get pitched everywhere. In software development the art of lying has become pervasive. Developers pitch their funders, their users, and anyone who will listen. And really developers are just <strong>pitching themselves</strong>, delusional about what their products are capable of doing.</p>

  <h2>Recent Meedan press</h2>
  <p>I&#39;ve had a great time working at Meedan recently as Director of Miscellany. We recently rolled out an update of the site and took of the &quot;beta&quot; label (it was out of style anyway).</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of interest generated -- turns out people are actually pretty interested in crowdsourced translation! </p>

<p>We&#39;ve got a lot of work ahead of us, but at least we are iterating live again now, and we have an incredibly supportive community getting our little nonprofit through the buggy spots. </p>

<p>Anyway, the recent press clippings: </p>

<p>The Economist discusses the human-machine &quot;cyborg translation&quot; approach in a <a href="http://www.economist.com/search/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15582327">summary piece</a> mentioning Meedan as well as our friends at Worldwide Lexicon and Global Voices.</p>

<p>The London Guardian wrote a nice <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/feb/21/translation-website-meedan-middle-east">article</a>: </p>

<blockquote>The system, which has been in development for more than three years, is based on advanced automatic translation technology developed by IBM and uses an international team of 30 translators and editors to find news and polish the language. ... With the potential for highly localised websites that cannot even be reached by outsiders — let alone understood — many have worried about the potential for a series of so-called "splinternets" to evolve.
</blockquote>

<p>The Guardian also as wrote a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/feb/22/meedan-machine-translation-mt">blog post</a> mentioning our Arabic-English <a href="http://meedan.org/2009/11/meedan-releases-the-world-e2-80-99s-first-open-access-arabicenglish-translation-memory">Open Translation Memory</a>. I appreciated this one because it at least mentioned our desire to move to WWL (away from a proprietary IBM backend which we have been loaned): </p>

<blockquote>Meedan's data — its 'translation memory' of over 3m words — is available to other translators. Weyman says: "the translations that are done with the Transbrowser are part of our agreement with IBM that makes sure all those translations are open source." This isn't true of some other web-based translation services, which are open access but not open source data services. The 'translation memory' is important because having a corpus of texts in two languages allows you to apply statistical techniques to improve a translation engine.
</blockquote>

<p>Le Monde covered Meedan in French! Here&#39;s the <a href="http://pisani.blog.lemonde.fr/2010/02/26/adressez-vous-aux-gens-dans-l%E2%80%99idiome-qu%E2%80%99ils-comprennent/">original French</a> and the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http://pisani.blog.lemonde.fr/2010/02/26/adressez-vous-aux-gens-dans-l%E2%80%99idiome-qu%E2%80%99ils-comprennent/&sl=auto&tl=en">translation</a>.  (It&#39;s actually quite readable MT for a change -- French to English machine translation does not need humans nearly so much as Arabic to English.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/02/22/2038241/New-EnglishArabic-Translation-Site-Hopes-To-Promote-Citizen-Diplomacy">Slashdot discussion</a> of Meedan is hilariously bad yet somehow deeply insightful as a document of the Slashdot community (they are mostly terrified that Meedan will cause WWIII -- hasn&#39;t happened yet, guys.) At least they properly crashed the site for a bit, truly Slashdotted! (Or maybe that&#39;s what I get for pretending to be a Postgres admin.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/02/arabic-english-diplomacy/">Wired ran a great article</a> and even ventured to mention the interaction design: </p>

<blockquote>
Meedan is not the first to make machine translation tools publicly usable -- Yahoo's Babel Fish has been around for years, and Google's Translate continues to improve and broaden its scope as the company uses its massive trove of search queries to tune its translation technology.

Meedan takes a different tack, first using Machine Translation technology, and then letting translators fix and refine translations. The status of a translation is always apparent, and learning a lesson from Wikipedia, Meedan makes the history of each translation publicly and quickly available.

The point is to not hide the messiness of translation and keep the reminder that this is a cross-cultural endeavor embedded in the site design.
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly a bit about Meedan appeared on BBC Arabic, in the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/digital/2010/02/arabic-english-website-meedan">New Statesman</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2010/02/22/meedan-blurs-linguistic-lines">on Al Jazeera</a>.</p>

  <h2>What could possibly go wrong? </h2>
  <p>What could possibly go wrong?  Thousands of volunteer hackers break ground on dozens of projects at a bunch of hastily organized unconferences promising to <em>Save Haiti</em>?</p>

<p>In a word: everything.</p>

<p>Tonight there are a number of people organizing some pretty intensive projects involving one of the most sensitive places in the world.</p>

<p>Let me tell you -- most of us have no idea what we are doing. Perhaps 5% of us have ever actually dealt directly in crisis response.  We are a bunch of dilettantes and armchair quarterbacks. We are normal people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m co-organizing one of the &quot;<a href="http://crisiscamp.org">Crisis Camps</a>&quot; here in Portland, and after a few days of work on project I think many things could go wrong with our approach. God forgive us. We will easily rebuild code that already exists, accidentally step on someone&#39;s toes, and flub a would-be partnership. It&#39;s even likely that our community will waste this rare opportunity to work with the real relief effort. Perhaps we just still won&#39;t get our act together, or we&#39;ll have an ineffective way of putting people to meaningful work. In fact, it is possible that things could go <em>very</em> wrong, far beyond wasted coding effort on a Saturday -- Just imagine the insanity that a few poorly trained volunteers could unleash with a simple list of phone numbers.</p>

<p>It is a responsibility we do not fully understand. As civic actors, we are struggling to participate and innovate remotely, with data. Very strange, that this is possible now: We can act, even from our cubicles, or in pajamas, to improve Haiti. Even though we haven&#39;t figured out all the interaction design yet, it&#39;s possible now. And the Man is starting to listen to us.</p>

<p>So, I will post screenshots of all the innovations later but for now, just before going to this event, I&#39;m worried that we might flub our responsibilities in a way that could destroy lives and wreck a movement. It would not take much, to break rules that we did not even know existed yet. </p>

<p>Those who work as civic editors and engineers -- the crazy beautiful hackers and hippies and good people who are working at crisis camps all over the world tomorrow -- please remember that you are in a much larger ecosystem of response efforts and you bear a great deal of responsibility to <em>them all.</em> Please be diligent and critical in your many response efforts. And check the mindset you bring to the new conversation about the digital response for Haiti. We have an enormous amount to learn.</p>

  <h2>'Slashtags' for citizen editors</h2>
  <p>Updated Nov 16, 2009: @chrismessina created a wiki for the Twitter syntax <a href="http://microsyntax.pbworks.com/Slashtags"><a href="http://microsyntax.pbworks.com/Slashtags">http://microsyntax.pbworks.com/Slashtags</a></a></p>

<p>The NYT reported today on how the <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23fthood">#fthood hashtag</a> has failed: </p>

<blockquote>Until lately, the main way to make sense of an urgent outpouring of tweets on a particular subject was to use text searches: look for the phrase 'Fort Hood,' for example, or maybe an agreed-upon label, '#fthood,' within tweets. Yet during events like the shootings on Thursday at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead, this method is useless. Hundreds of 'relevant' tweets pop up every minute, most repeating the same news reports over and over again or expressing concern from far away.<span class="attribution">"Refining the Twitter Explosion" on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/09link.html">nyt.com</a></blockquote>

<p>I believe that there is an enormous potential to do citizen journalism better on the web, and that we need the leadership of people who are willing to help clean up the mess. Unlike <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/07/nsfw-after-fort-hood-another-example-of-how-citizen-journalists-cant-handle-the-truth/">some people</a>, I do not think that the poor citizen journalism around #fthood is an indictment of citizen journalism -- rather I would say it points to the <strong>absence of citizen editors</strong>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://blog.twittervotereport.com/">Vote Report</a> and <a href="http://swiftapp.org">Swift</a> parlance, these are &quot;Sweepers,&quot; the custodians working to clean the stream, validate claims, and generally insert some professionalism.</p>

<p>Taken to their logical next step, you can see the emergence of volunteer &quot;citizen editors,&quot; who appreciate journalistic rigor and take time to bring  signal to the noise in dozens of different ways.</p>

<p>Recently around Meedan we have been talking a lot about using <a href="http://delicious.com">Delicious</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> tagging to more effectively manage our content across our many networks, and to bring more meaningful conversations to our users.</p>

<p>This is the power of tags: they are impossible to contain in a single network.</p>

<p>By relying on Delicious and other social bookmarking systems, we&#39;ve been able to build our <strong>editorial backchannel into numerous social platforms</strong>. Rather than being stuck with the limitations of some CMS, and have to copy everything out to our social network, we can use the social network and <strong>then bring it in</strong> to our own domains.</p>

<p>That&#39;s always a smart approach for nonprofits, because it builds your conversation in a meaningful, and searchable way. Metadata value (real usable value!) accumulates like interest in your bank account. And citizen editors are the people who are trying to make this system provide even more of a return, because fundamentally we want more people to <strong>care, understand and take action</strong>.</p>

<h3>Twitter Lists Taken Seriously</h3>

<p>So we&#39;ve been looking into some of the existing pseudo-standards like the #hashtag, and looking for ways for improving our journalistic rigor. George <a href="http://blog.meedan.net/2009/11/04/10-questions-for-establishing-credibility-on-twitter/">recently posted</a> about using the new Twitter lists features to curate groups of sources for <a href="http://twitter.com/meedan/iran-feed">our Iran Twitter feed</a>: </p>

<p>Rather than treating our Twitter list as a gizmo, with shoddy maintenance and dubious output, what if we put some rigor into it by beginning with Journalism 101? </p>

<p>George, our lead editor, knows this stuff all too well: </p>

<blockquote>
What is the reported location of the Twitter Stream?
Is the Twitter Stream using Farsi or a local language?
How long has the Twitter Stream account been up and running?
</blockquote>

<p>(And oh yes there are <a href="http://blog.meedan.net">many more criteria</a>.)</p>

<p>I think these are the good, basic questions that may not be answered by some organizations -- and their lists are thus quantifiably worse, in the sense that they are less reliable, less meaningful, and probably noiser. So we can see that by following basic journalistic standards, your attention data becomes more valuable. Garbage in, garbage out, or, more positively, the system can be improved.</p>

<p>For nonprofits, which typically do not have a <strong>microgram of energy to spare</strong>, these kinds of tricks can be really helpful. </p>

<h3>#hashtags and /slashtags</h3>

<p>A great example of this type of &quot;attention data enhancement&quot; is the #hastag, which clarifies the context of a short statement on twitter with a globally recognizable tagging syntax. (I&#39;ll spare us the debate around hashtags, but suffice it to say, they can be done better.)</p>

<p>Chris Messina, one of the biggest advocates of #hashtags and other microsyntax, has just <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/11/08/new-microsytax-for-twitter-three-pointers-and-the-slasher/">described a few extra bits of attribution</a> using the &quot;slasher.&quot; (I think we could just call it a &quot;slashtag.&quot;)</p>

<blockquote>'Pointers' are short words with different intentions. A group of pointers should typically be prefixed by ONE slasher character. You can daisy-chain multiple pointer phrases together, padded on both sides with one whitespace character. There should be NO space following the slasher. Hashtags should be appended to the very end of a tweet, except when they are part of the content of the message itself and indicate some proper name or abbreviation. Normal words that would be part of the content of a tweet anyway SHOULD NOT be hashed.<span class="attribution">"<a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/11/08/new-microsytax-for-twitter-three-pointers-and-the-slasher/">New microsyntax for Twitter: three pointers and the slasher</a>"</span>
</blockquote>

<p>Particularly I think <strong>using /by</strong> is a great idea to reference an article or direct quote. </p>

<p>Using /by gives a very specific meaning to the username that follows it. It&#39;s intuitive enough that I don&#39;t think it even needs to be explained, you can just read it: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/unthinkingly/4088475379/" title="by by unthinkingly, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2455/4088475379_cf90c0b1e5_o.jpg" width="623" height="268" alt="by" /></a></p>

<p>Not beautiful, but very clear. </p>

<p>This is useful for when you need to be more precise — say, if you wanted to use your attention data <strong>in another application</strong>.</p>

<p>For us at Meedan, this is the direction we are headed, fast. We are working on developing a clear and simple standard for using tags on the delicious network. This standard will be something that <strong>our editorial team</strong> (and <strong>anyone who cares to participate</strong>) can use to route information to our hand-curated database. You don&#39;t have to leave the comfort of your own twitter client, or use any fancy tools -- just the simple, clear standards that we are figuring out. </p>

<p>We are already making great use of social bookmarks at meedan as a editorial backchannel. For example, you can see all of Meedan&#39;s Iraq sources on delicious, from our lead editor: </p>

<p><a href="http://delicious.com/gweyman/iraq_newspaper"><a href="http://delicious.com/gweyman/iraq_newspaper">http://delicious.com/gweyman/iraq_newspaper</a></a></p>

<p>And everything that the Meedan user unthinkingly (me) has tagged as being generically &quot;for meedan&quot; (using an informal tag &quot;for_meedan&quot;).</p>

<p><a href="http://delicious.com/unthinkingly/for_meedan"><a href="http://delicious.com/unthinkingly/for_meedan">http://delicious.com/unthinkingly/for_meedan</a></a></p>

<p>Because George also uses this tag, we can get a nice community of practice working together. This page shows the shared pool: </p>

<p><a href="http://delicious.com/tag/for_meedan"><a href="http://delicious.com/tag/for_meedan">http://delicious.com/tag/for_meedan</a></a></p>

<p>So, as you can see, we are using underscores, which is a common tagging convention because it looks like a space. We&#39;re not so happy with this: it&#39;s simply not expressive enough. </p>

<p>(Even though you can do a lot with a single little shared tag like <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/2007/01/10/understanding-a-community-tag-the-history-of-nptech/">#nptech</a>.)</p>

<p>A more robust tagging system, which I believe would be very compelling if it were well designed, would extend some of this syntax. The question is: <strong>how to extend the syntax without making it overwhelming?</strong> </p>

<h3>Setting some goals</h3>

<p>I think that any tag needs to follow a standard that meets several critiera: </p>

<p>1.) it should read naturally when spoken out loud (no dots, equals signs, or weird abbreviations)
2.) it should be as cross-network as possible (for now the syntax should not break on Twitter or Delicious) [1]
3.) it should rely an aliases instead of strict taxonomies (tag first, fix it later)</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m talking about is extending the tag that George used to curate Iraqi newspapers,
<strong>
iraq_newspaper
</strong>
to something like this:</p>

<p><strong>/newspaper/iraq</strong></p>

<p>which I think has several advantages.</p>

<ol>
<li>of the tag in ways that make the taxonomy immediately clearer. Iraq is nested &quot;inside&quot; a type of source.</li>
<li>It works on Twitter</li>
<li>It works on Delicious</li>
<li>It is still very short (adds only one character over the underscore)</li>
</ol>

<p>On delicious, spaces are not allowed, so I have started using two slashes. So where previously I might have tagged the article with a kind of meaningless tag:</p>

<p><strong>chrismessina</strong></p>

<p>but now I can tag it</p>

<p><strong>/by/chrismessina</strong></p>

<p>Which is still a pretty meaningless tag, but is at least prefixed meaningfully to mean &quot;this content is by this person&quot; as per chris&#39; helpful article above.</p>

<p>Also I can improve the previous technique of using the for_meedan shorthand</p>

<p>from </p>

<p><strong>for_meedan</strong></p>

<p>to </p>

<p><strong>/for/meedan</strong></p>

<p>Which has the benefit of being equally readable, while obeying a more general rule of syntax.</p>

<h3>Machine tags are not what we want, we are not machines</h3>

<p>By far the most complete standard that is being used to solve these problems is the machine tag. This tag uses a colon and an equals sign to indicate a much more specific (though not necessarily accurate) structure. The history is from the geo community, mostly for this: </p>

<p><strong>geo:long=45.353452</strong></p>

<p>These namespaced key value pairs are admirably used as the output of some web apps, but are quite intimidating for human input.</p>

<p>Common opinion seems to be that they are too &quot;<a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/09/28/thats-maybe-a-bit-too-dorky-even-for-us/">dorky</a>&quot; to be usable at this point, considering especially that any good taxonomy is constantly in slight flux. (Though Flickr has made great use of them to kick of <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/09/28/thats-maybe-a-bit-too-dorky-even-for-us/">custom actions in their UI</a>).</p>

<p>Similarly, what might be called a &quot;double tag&quot; is an interesting simplification down to a context-less key value pair: </p>

<p><strong>color=red</strong></p>

<p>In fact this is what comprises almost all of the tags in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a>, one of the most ambitious tagging innovations on the web. (I <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/unthinkingly">have said before</a> that tagging is the secret sauce that makes a crazy project like OSM work.)</p>

<h3>Finding a balance</h3>

<p>Replace the equals sign in that last example, and you have slashtags, which I think are much better at communicating that &quot;color&quot; is a parent of the &quot;red&quot; value: </p>

<p><strong>color/red</strong></p>

<p>In this way, this &quot;slashtag&quot; or &quot;slasher&quot; approach, extended a with tiny bit of folksonomic conventions, could really strike the right balance between editorial simplicity and powerful machine-readablity. </p>

<h3>Finding better editorial tools for realtime crises</h3>

<p>I think that a better-defined tagging approach could really help make sense of critical, breaking news. </p>

<p>A wiki about hurricane Ida, for example, is probably not the right way to manage news about a critical event:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/unthinkingly/4089097932/" title="ida by unthinkingly, on Flickr">
  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2712/4089097932_350f83174c.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="ida" />
</a></p>

<p>Mediawiki makes me groan just looking at it. I&#39;d much rather help update that information by tagging links into delicious, and knowing that someone is listening on the other end. This would motivate me to learn the emergent standards, follow a loose taxonomy, and generally try to be more <strong>articulate</strong>.</p>

<p>If we could react in realtime to create a more sophisticated picture of the news by expressing ourselves more clearly in the tagging interaction, I think we could ultimately make great strides in improving citizen journalism (even if all the idiots keep on tweeting, which, naturally, they will.)</p>

<p>This is why the usability of a citizen editor tagging scheme is so critical -- it needs to be flexible enough (to handle hurricanes) but maintain a low barrier to participation (to cultivate citizen editors). The tagging approach has already proven itself in many trivial domains, now we need to step it up using our journalistic standards, and our shared interest in <strong>making sense of the news, particularly crises</strong>.</p>

<p>We are early in this strange<strong> distributed crisis data management effort</strong>, but I think that some of the ideas proposed by Chris Messina, and the experiments of the OSM community go a really long way in this regard. Particularly the nestabilty and readability seem like great virtues of this tagging system. Overall the &quot;slash&quot; is a widely understood metaphor, used by all major operating systems to indicate travresing &quot;down&quot; or &quot;up&quot; a taxonomy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to transition some of my tagging habits accordingly, and see where it ends up!</p>

<p>I would love to know what you think. Stop by the contact page or @unthinkingly on Twitter and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>[1] notice how it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/unthinkingly/4088326441/">breaks on gnolia.com</a> 
and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/unthinkingly/4088331717/">breaks on flickr.com</a> Although it appears that Flickr preserves the slashes in the background, just doesn&#39;t display them on output.</p>

<p>[2] On Twitter there is s a bit of a variation required if we are to follow existing patterns: 1.) I can omit the space, so I will, and 2.) You need to prefix a user&#39;s name with the @ sign, like <strong>/for @meedan </strong> -- I think this is still quite readable, but the difference between networks might need to be cleared up. We could in fact collapse the twitter tags to <strong>/for/meedan</strong> (ie: identical to the delicious tag) but this would probably break some automation in twitter clients that are expecting the @ prefix. </p>

My current development activies (as a frontend coder and interaction designer) will be released over the course of 2008 at <a href="http://meedan.net"><a href="http://meedan.net">http://meedan.net</a></a> and <a href="http://swiftapp.org"><a href="http://swiftapp.org">http://swiftapp.org</a></a>. </p>

  <h2>How Much Do You Trust Your Own Network?</h2>
  <p>Some time ago, I joined Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/unthinkingly">@unthinkingly</a>, and I loved it. Then, something felt wrong, and I deleted a bunch of followers. First I went down to 200 people, then 100, then 50, and it still was <strong>somehow wrong</strong>, so I quietly slipped out the door. Nobody really complained. I think many people have experience this burnout. Twitter is kinda hard. There&#39;s just so much happening. To me, what was exciting became overwhelming. Serendipity curdled into distraction. </p>

<p>When I left I was incredibly relieved. I could stop listening and start kicking ass.</p>

<p>So, I took a break, moved away from the ever-intense San Francisco bubble, worked in Cambodia, wrote a bunch of code ... and now, hey look! I&#39;m back on Twitter. But, just to confuse you, I&#39;ve setup not one but <strong>two Twitter accounts</strong>: the old <a href="http://twitter.com/unthinkingly">@unthinkingly</a> is back for professional stuff, and now <a href="http://twitter.com/cgblow">@cgblow</a> for more private personal observations.</p>

<p>Turns out, it&#39;s such a simple and healthy solution; I don&#39;t know why more people don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s not a complicated hack or anything, you just have to use a separate email account. (A tool like <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/" title="Seesmic: Build Your Community">Seesmic Desktop</a> lets you stay signed into both at the same time.)</p>

<p>Now, please don&#39;t misundersand me: I strongly believe in living a principled, genuine life. Naive as it sounds, I try to never ever say anything that I would not say to someone&#39;s face. Life is too hard that way. I&#39;m an incompetent liar. I don&#39;t maintain multiple personalities -- I have a single, genuine and faceted personality. Just like most people I know.</p>

<h3>Back in the Day</h3>

<p>As an application designer, I keep spotting architectures that expect, and in some cases force, me to have a single, monolithic expression of my personality. I take offense to this because we, as humans, are all multi-faceted. We speak to our parents differently than our coworkers. We lower our voices a bit in a crowded coffee shop. We stand up straighter when we give a presentation. And, again, these are not about secrecy or duplicity, but rather, indications of maturity, and a uniquely human sophistication.</p>

<p>Back in the day, we did this better, probably by accident. We didn&#39;t have ways to prevent you from creating multiple accounts. We didn&#39;t really need to -- there were no zombie spammers. From an application design perspective, the geography was totally different because of this difference. We had tiny little awesome communities. Your importance was judged more by what you said than how many &quot;friends&quot; you had. </p>

<p>Back in the day, you were expected to have a short pseudonym, a handle, that you could use (or not use) across any bulliten board you wanted. And on IRC in particular, you can (still!) register dozens of pseudonyms if you wanted to, and express yourself appropriately in different contexts. You can whisper, lurk and rant, all at the same time. Just like you can in real life. </p>

<h3>The Test</h3>

<p>In thinking this through, I realized that the most irritating thing wasn&#39;t really about the information overload thing. That&#39;s still there.</p>

<p>What I found on Twitter, the way I was using it, was a lack of trust. And, get this, -- not other people trusting me, but me actually trusting <strong>my own network</strong>.</p>

<p>So, I created a test for <a href="http://twitter.com/cgblow">@cgblow</a>. In order to set the bar a little higher, and really give myself a break from some of these frustrations, I have simple, but hardcore, criteria for who I&#39;ll follow with @cgblow: <strong>I could give you the root password to my computer</strong>. In fact, I&#39;ll Twitter it right now. Done.</p>

<p>How much do you really trust your network? What can you say, and what is off limits because you have to say it to <strong>everyone</strong>? How does a sprawling, Facebook-style personality portal limit your experience of genuine community? How much do you trust your own network?</p>

  <h2>The "Special Case" of NEED Magazine</h2>
  <p>During the collapse of the journalism industry, I have rarely been surprised -- and only occasionally truly saddend -- by a newspaper going out of business. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t have empathy. I have worked briefly as a journalist, have a degree in journalism, and many of my professional heroes are journalists. I actually attribute most of humanity&#39;s advances in the last 100 years to communications infrastructure, particularly good journalism. </p>

<p>And still, I make a living with news. So, it&#39;s only with my teeth clenched that I can say, &quot;we need this&quot; and try to keep the longer view toward the 1500s, and the previous revolutions that fell out of Gutenberg&#39;s noodling with the press. Like Clay Shirky says. He&#39;s pretty blunt: </p>

<blockquote>Round and round this goes, with the people committed to saving newspapers demanding to know if the old model is broken, what will work in its place? To which the answer is: Nothing. Nothing will work. There is no general model for newspapers to replace the one the internet just broke. <span class="attribution">Clay Shirky in <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">Thinking the Unthinkable</a></span></blockquote>

<p>I agree with Shirky that this is an inevitable collapse of the old school. And I agree that our best option is to work as creatively as possible to <em>get through it and find another way</em> to make meaning, to build understanding, to be journalists. </p>

<p>The thing is, it&#39;s brutal. And it&#39;s not just print -- all news costs money. Meaning-making takes energy. Real editors, real photographers, real writers. And, yes there is still the bottom line of printing. (Or, in my case, the expenses of wrangling servers.)</p>

<p>The collapse is even harder to accept if your family depends on a paycheck from your publisher. We want it to work, and we want to think it will be better soon. </p>

<p>But anyone who has worked in a newsroom knows the sucking sound that comes from the ad department. Most times the demanding economics <em>ruin</em> the possibility of doing quality work. You <em>must</em> write news that sells, which is typically not news that edifies, inspires or enlightens. It means that you end up writing stories about <a href="http://whiteafrican.com/2008/03/12/pothole-theory-lost-fingers-caring-and-crisis/">potholes on your street</a> instead of international events. Because international events are, for most people, irrelevant, if not unreadable.</p>

<p>To some degree this gulf between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; is understandable, or at least it has been until now. We do not want to pay for news that is not relevant to our own lives. </p>

<p>But relevance is, well, relative. Our sphere of influence has expanded dramatically with the internet, and with globalization. And today we live with an infrastructure that extends our relevance to millions of people that we do not know: this is the problem. We have not learned to care about things -- people -- that are in fact relevant now to our lives. We haven&#39;t learned to care about the people who make our socks, our bikes and our computers. We haven&#39;t learned to care about the people we influence with our policies and purchases. We are all bumping up against one another now, unwittingly. </p>

<p>And we haven&#39;t learned to pay for news about these people, other people.</p>

<p>This, I think, is understandable. That&#39;s the tragic part, I suppose: We are humans running on hardware that is incredibly out of date: the human brain. We have evolved, biologically and culturally, to get by, to survive, and to take care of our own. We now have influence that far exceed out capacity to understand. We experience sometimes deep existential disconnect from each other; there are simple too many &quot;Others&quot; to care about; we are atomized the most just when we are bumping into each other the hardest. </p>

<p>Even the concept of philanthropy, I would say, is in some way fundamentally inhuman in this sense. We were not born to care about others until we have taken care of our own.</p>

<p>But today buying articles about distant cultures is not about philanthropy. It&#39;s not even about being interested in other people. </p>

<p>That is, this is not an issue of being kind, or being well-mannered and cultured, it is actually essential for survival now -- we must to understand these things, these Others. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily">Homophily</a> is not just a cultural phenomenon or academic observation -- this problem is <em>actually deadly</em>. Just as previous generations were forced to adapt to environmental change and technological capacity.</p>

<p>As usual, Ethan Zuckerman writes about this best: </p>

<blockquote>Understanding Iraqi attitudes towards a US occupying force and Shia/Sunni/Kurdish tensions better might have mitigated the disastrous invasion of Iraq. Understanding Chinese and Indian economic aspirations is probably a prerequisite to figuring out how to regulate carbon emissions while those nations embrace automobile ownership. And activists trying to change Chinese policy in Darfur would benefit from better understanding of Chinese pride, the concept of 'face' and the power of nationalism. <span class="attribution">- Ethan Z. in <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/04/25/homophily-serendipity-xenophilia/">Homophily, serendipity, xenophilia</a></span></blockquote>

<hr>

<p>It&#39;s with this context that I am really sad to see that <a href="http://www.needmagazine.com/">NEED magazine is very close to going out of business</a>. </p>

<p>In 2006 <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/2006/12/05/need-magazine-debuts/">I noted their premier issue</a> and have been incredibly impressed by the work that they have done ever since. It&#39;s just an amazing, beautiful magazine about humanitarian work and the people involved on the ground. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s their two-sentence angle on the world:</p>

<blockquote>NEED magazine is an artistic hope-filled publication focusing on life changing humanitarian efforts at home and abroad.  We are not out to save the world, but to tell the stories of, and assist, those who are.<span class="attribution"><a href="http://needmagazine.com">NEED Magazine</a></span></blockquote>
 

<p><img class="align-right" src="http://blog.meedan.net/images/premierecover1.jpg" alt="Need" title "Need magazine" /></p>

<p>If you have never seen it, you should check it out -- it&#39;s the highest quality printing that you can get, with gigantic gorgeous photos of some truly incredible stories. A rare find.</p>

<p>So I was incredibly disappointed to get an email from them this morning explaining their difficulties with revenue, especially after they <a href="http://needmagazine.com">suffered a major break-in</a> last year, that cost them nearly $250,000, I hear.   It&#39;s a sad story, especially as we watch the last gasp of the newspaper industry, weakened by it&#39;s ad model, now totally broken by the freedom of the internet.</p>

<p>What should they do? </p>

<p>Who knows. </p>

<p>And, to their credit, they are soliciting opinions about what it is that <strong>we would actually pay for</strong>. I applaud their willingness to completely reevaluate their business model -- take their <a href="http://needmagazine.com">new survey</a> and tell them how they should start anew.</p>

<p>Go NEED. We trust you will be bold in your experiments.</p>

<hr>

<p>At the end of <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/">his article</a>, Shirky&#39;s pessimism is tempered by his observation that previously minor adjustments have proven to be groundbreaking: &quot;nothing will work, but everything might. Now is the time for experiments, lots and lots of experiments.&quot; </p>

<p>Tinkering works. If you do it enough. Hmph. OK.</p>

<p>Well, the conclusion is not optimistic, but it is liberating -- we have the freedom to try many alternative models. We in fact must experiment and explore because anything we do can perhaps give us a window into some new way to make meaning that is relevant and readable. Even when people will no longer pay for news about international problems, there are ways to make these stories meaningful. Increasingly it becomes clearer that there is not one way, there are many ways, each appropriate to its community and its content. </p>

<p>These are the &quot;special cases&quot; that will make our patchwork understanding of the world. </p>

<p>Shirky again:</p>

<blockquote>For the next few decades, journalism will be made up of overlapping <strong>special cases</strong>. Many of these models will rely on amateurs as researchers and writers. Many of these models will rely on sponsorship or grants or endowments instead of revenues. Many of these models will rely on excitable 14 year olds distributing the results. <strong>Many of these models will fail</strong>. No one experiment is going to replace what we are now losing with the demise of news on paper, but over time, the collection of new experiments that do work might give us the journalism we need.
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<p>This is not really about NEED or newspapers. It&#39;s about all of the amazing groups that are bringing empathy and challenging homophily on the web. For those of us in online news, we are all looking for the &quot;special cases.&quot; </p>

<p>Meedan is exploring several special cases:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We take donations from funders</li>
    <li>We translate existing commentary</li>
    <li>We visualize, hack and aggregate content</li>
    <li>We host cross-language discussions about the news</li>
</ul>

<p>I think of these strategies, especially programmatic journalism (hack hack), as being <strong>temporary measures</strong>. In a country without farmland, you harvest dandelions from the side of the highway. You take what you can. Likewise, we are gleaners, making the most of the understanding that already exists. We just circulate it more widely with translation, bring it together in innovative ways with aggregation, and broadcast it more effectively with smart code. </p>

<p>More critically we talk about it in a wide-ranging discussion -- we recoup some of our lost community of newspapers by building our own. This creates our own content and gives us a more natural connection to news that is otherwise incredibly far away. And, fittingly,  we trample all over international borders as we do it.</p>

<p>These are some of our &quot;special cases&quot; where meaning making can actually work, even in a world where all information is free, and it&#39;s tough to make a living as a meaning-making journalist. We are finding, just a little bit at a time, the spaces where we can continue to promote empathy and community beyond the collapse of our traditional models.</p>

  <h2>ICCM 09, the Crisis Mapping Conference</h2>
  <p>In October I&#39;ll be geeking out at the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/">ICCM 09</a>, the first International Conference on Crisis Mapping. The conference is &quot;harnessing mobile platforms, computational linguistics, geospatial technologies, and visual analytics to power effective early warning for rapid response to complex humanitarian emergencies.&quot; </p>

<p>If you&#39;re scratching your head wondering what the field of crisis mapping is all about ... you&#39;re not alone! Good thing Patrick Meier has proposed a <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/proposing-crisis-mapping/">sketch of the field</a>. You have to love a guy who literally defines a field. Patrick is a collaborator at Ushahidi and Swift, and I have really been fortunate to see him at work, particularly his leadership in bridging academic and hacker-practitioner communities in this &quot;crisis&quot; space. It&#39;s the same thing that is making everyone so excited about this conference. Thanks, Patrick. </p>

<p>Cross-pollination at these conferences is incredibly important to our success. We&#39;re doing many of the same things over and over, with innovative twists appropriate to our context. We just don&#39;t know each other. Now we get to meet and work together for three days. I think it&#39;s terribly exciting because of an increasing sense that <em>we can all be doing these things much better</em>. </p>

<p>See also Crisis Camp West (Watch <a href="http://crisiscamp.org/">this space</a>, I think.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s this from the ICCM conference site:</p>

<blockquote>
The purpose of the 3-day conference to be held in Cleveland on October 16-18 is to bring together the most engaged practitioners, scholars, software developers and policymakers at the cutting edge of crisis mapping to define the future of the field along with best practices and lessons learned. We expect over 50 organizations to be represented and for multiple partnerships to be formed on specific projects during the conference. Please note this conference is by invitation only. See below for a list of invited partners.
</blockquote>

<p>I hope to meet a few of my friends that I don&#39;t get to see enough, and meet a few new people working on great stuff. Check out the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/profiles/members/">people that are involved</a> and some of the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/group/signupforignitetalks/forum/topics/add-your-ignite-talk-proposal">planned talks</a>. Probably there will be a lot of discussion about how to use <a href="http://swiftapp.org">Swift</a>, and I might be demoing a new project about the rapid deployment of applications like Ushahidi and Meedan.</p>

<p><strong>Correction: You can&#39;t come out and hack because (upon closer reading) it&#39;s apparently a closed conference. Frankly I&#39;m disappointed.</strong></p>

  <h2>OpenStreetMap Cambodia</h2>
  <p>I&#39;ve been doing a series of presentations here <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/2009/06/29/sustainable-interaction-design-in-cambodia/">at the InSTEDD lab</a> in Phom Penh, and so far the best-received one has been (to my surprise) about something I really just getting into:  <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. I figured that this would be a good-spirited critical discussion about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">FOSS</a> philosophy given that <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009063026788/Business/Google-meeting-held-at-Royal-University.html">Google was in town</a>. :) I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be quite so engaging for the lab though -- I think they all had a great time. </p>

<p><img src="/images/picture-24-300x223.png" alt="taking_notes" title="taking_notes" width="300" height="223" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-394" /></p>

<p>We did an introductory <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_party">mapping party</a> and I explained some of my appreciation for OSM, particularly the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Palestine_Gaza">Gaza mapping</a> that happened early this year.</p>

<p>I am an OSM newbie myself so I was just happy that we managed to get everything working end to end (using GPS devices kindly loaned by the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Foundation">OSM Foundation</a> -- thanks <a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/">Mikel</a>!) Also thanks to <a href="http://thinkwhere.wordpress.com/">Chippy</a> for leading the OSM session last month that answered my questions about the OSM toolchain and gave me the idea for doing an intro party in Phonm Penh.

  <h2>Sustainable Interaction Design in Cambodia</h2>
  <p>So, I&#39;ve spent almost a month now as a resident geek at the <a href="http://instedd.org">InSTEDD</a> Innovation Lab in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. </p>

<p>InSTEDD is working on epidemiology-related technologies that are very relevant to my research interests:</p>

<blockquote>InSTEDD's mission is to harness the power of technology to improve collaboration for global health and humanitarian action.  We are an innovation lab for tools designed to strengthen networks, build community resilience and improve early detection and response to major health-related events and natural or human-caused disasters. <br /> - <a href="http://instedd.org/">InSTEDD.org</a></blockquote>

<p>I was invited to their Cambodian lab to give a usability review to some of their software, and to give some interaction design training to their team. It&#39;s been a fantastic escape from San Francisco. Cambodia has been alternating depressing, exciting, confirming and challenging. Certainly I have learned more than I have been able to teach.</p>

<p>Last winter I was doing some preliminary research for <a href="http://swiftapp.org">Swift</a>, and contacted InSTEDD to learn more about their platform for &quot;team-sourcing&quot; the analysis of information about the spread of disease. (I was given a preview of <a href="http://instedd.org/evolve">Evolve</a> and thoroughly blown away.) I was super impressed with <a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/09/phnom-penh-innovation-lab-team-giving.html">Eduardo&#39;s explanation of the lab</a>, and happily jumped at the invitation to work as resident in Phnom Penh.</p>

<blockquote>As part of InSTEDD's strategy of 'sustainable innovation' we are creating a full engineering team that over time owns and reinvents technologies used in the region. All technologies go obsolete - so for true sustainability you need to assemble a team of people that will invent the 'next thing' - and give it the skills, capital and opportunities to do so.
<br /><span class="attribution">- @edjez</span></blockquote> 

<p>I actually had no idea what to expect here. I&#39;ve lived in the woods a couple years without bandwidth, but I&#39;d never really worked as a designer or developer in conditions quite like this. Phnom Penh has its fancy bits, for sure (the lab here is quite nice), but you are never far from tragedy. </p>

<p>Particularly the history in Cambodia is haunting. An entire generation of intellectuals and hackers, killed. There are no second-generation programmers in Cambodia. It&#39;s terrifying. The horrors of poverty are nothing compared to human nature. Somehow being a user-centered technologist means understanding this. Somehow.</p>

<p>I work on a lot of international projects, but at the end of the day I am just a homebody country mouse -- I&#39;ve hardly traveled at all, especially compared to the jet-set geeks that I tag along with. So a 15-hour flight to Phnom Penh seemed like a good tonic. I couldn&#39;t imagine a more appropriate place for understanding technological capacity, understanding humans, understanding human-centered design.</p>

<p>I have some rather deep frustrations with San Francisco. I feel really lucky to have lived and worked there, but after a couple of years I am more than ready to get out -- most developers are overpaid, overworked, out of touch with the world. I have encountered enough dispassionate, disengaged arrogance from <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/2008/12/03/trying-to-quit/">rich programmer zombie dudes</a> that I have been ready to quit programming altogether. </p>

<p>So, as much as I have an interest in technology for the developing world, I&#39;ve been longing for more first-hand experience with austere (read: realistic) technological environments. As a developer and designer I consider this just due diligence; it&#39;s basic design research about the real world, the real design problem. <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/2006/12/06/design-for-maximum-constraints/">Designing for maximum constraints</a> just doesn&#39;t really work from San Francisco bubble.</p>

<p>One of the great lures of Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) is the possibility of &quot;leapfrogging&quot; old technologies and bringing major changes to the developing world. But leapfrogging technologies are not possible unless they address the much more subtle cultural issues. Which is to say, the process of technological advancement must be in organic, not imposed. San Francisco (or London or Berlin) solutions will never work in Cambodia. It&#39;s fundamentally an interaction design problem, which is has to be addressed by <em>changing the conditions in which software is created</em>.</p>

<p>InSTEDD has created the Phnom Penh lab to put development in the hands of the people that will be using it: Cambodians dealing with epidemics in Cambodia. </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> understands this deeply, cultivates serious African talent, and is working on a lab in Kenya, I hear.</p>

<p>At my nonprofit <a href="http://meedan.net">Meedan</a> we hope to learn from this leadership and create a tech lab in Syria, where Arabic-speaking programmers from the Middle East -- people who deeply understand the design needs of that region -- will be in charge of developing our most important technologies. This, I think, is the simplest and most appropriate model for sustainable interaction design, and I am thrilled to work with people who get it.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2009/05/07/swift.html">Swift</a> <span>May  7</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>Swift</h2>
  <p>For the last 5 months I&#39;ve been working with friends at <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> and <a href="http://meedan.net">Meedan</a> on a project nicknamed &quot;Swift.&quot;</p>

<p>Our goal with Swift is to provide a crowdsourcing platform for &quot;data triage.&quot; Imagine something like Mechanical Turk used only for tagging news, photos, microblogging and videos. There&#39;s no business model or anything like that -- it&#39;s strictly Open Source Nonprofity Goodness(tm). Meedan and Ushahidi are partners in hacking it out.</p>

<p>As a user of Swift you can sit down at an &quot;assembly line&quot; of news and tag it. Swift gives you a straightforward aggregator for news (say, news about earthquakes in california) then asks you to tag all of the people, places and organizations in that firehose of data. With a little bit of effort (collecting a few rss feeds and marking up all the content) it becomes possible to put a very bright light on an emerging part of the web. You can, for example, tag violations of electoral code in an election, as we are doing with <a href="http://votereport.in">Vote Report India</a>, which uses Ushahidi and Wordpress as a platform for grassroots reporting in the month-long Indian election. </p>

<p>I&#39;m especially interested in knowing how much we can actually <em>do</em> with the public data that emerges in realtime during a crisis. From a journalistic perspective, it seems like there is an opportunity to understand more concretely <strong>what the hell is going on</strong>.</p>

<p>For Ushahidi, Swift is an extension of their exisiting SMS reporting cycle. By &quot;listening&quot; to the &quot;outside&quot; web in a more structured way, the hope is that we can provide more relevant alerts to people on the ground in a crisis. </p>

<p>For Meedan, Swift is a tool for a team of editors who need to produce interesting content for their digital newsroom. Because it is an aggregator, Swift serves naturally as a listening post as well as a tagging workbench. Rope in a few feeds (such as <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=election">Twitter search results feed for &quot;election&quot; </a>) and then do location extraction for the Middle East with <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">Calais</a> on that feed, and you have a pretty cool stream of entities.</p>

<p>Swift seeks to publish all of the entities that concerned communities publish about crisis, both hot flash and slow burn events. The core use case is for the period immediately following a disaster or crisis, during the hours and days of confusion. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>One thing that is always interesting about Swift is that it is a very unusual use case. The tragedy of a crisis creates a temporary period of great social empathy during which many &quot;rules&quot; of interaction design break down. This is a design opportunity. Many people are willing to match their #have to someone else&#39;s #need, but they don&#39;t have a medium for volunteering, or a network of supporters who can contextualize and respect their work. We just watch CNN and feel powerless; we would love a way to help, as an individual, from across the world. An improved marketplace of volunteerism is possible if we can design the appropriate interactions.</p>

  <h2>Trying to Quit</h2>
  <p>I have been trying to quit programming for about six months. </p>

<p>I&#39;m down to about 2 times a day, on average, sometimes more. It&#39;s a problem. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, programming is one of the best disciplines I ever stuck my nose into. Programming teaches you fundamentally how to <em>constantly improve your craft</em>. But it&#39;s exhausting, distracting, and inseparable from the cult of efficiency. It takes you away from humans, mashes your nose into an LCD all night, and leaves you with a delusional sense of total control over your environment. I wish that I could take back every second of my life that I spent learning to build stacks and refactor my own crappy code. </p>

<p>The problem is that code is so damn useful. It beckons with APIs and gives you entire weekends of mindless flow; hack, hack, hack, make it pretty and fast.</p>

<p>So anyway, I&#39;m working on it.</p>

<blockquote>
On December 9, 1968, Dr. Douglas C. Engelbart and the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) at Stanford Research Institute staged a 90-minute public multimedia demonstration at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. It was the world debut of personal and interactive computing: for the first time, the public saw a computer mouse, which controlled a networked computer system to demonstrate hypertext linking, real-time text editing, multiple windows with flexible view control, cathode display tubes, and shared-screen teleconferencing.

It changed what is possible. The 1968 demo presaged many of the technologies we use today, from personal computing to social networking. The demo embodied Doug Engelbart's vision of solving humanity's most important problems by using computers to improve communication and collaboration.</blockquote>

<p>Just found out about <a href="http://livelabs.com/blog/keeping-current-with-political-streams/">Political Streams</a>.</p>

<p>I really do like this idea, but reinventing the pie chart with those desaturated squares is not a good start. I&#39;ll be checking it out to see how they iterate on representing the concept, which is fascinating.</p>

<blockquote>It mines information from all the blogs and Web sites out there, and all on one screen, lets you see the relative popularity of any given story, whether it's trending up or down, and tracks the number of mentions of the people and places mentioned in the story. </blockquote>

<p>The graphs, by contrast are wonderful and straightforward:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2008/10/sstreams_new_2.png" alt="" title="sstreams_new_2" width="433" height="275" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-277" /></p>

<p>oh and cf. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/blews/blews.aspx">Microsoft Blews (TM)</a> which has similar data (and infoviz problems). </p>

<blockquote>While typical news-aggregation sites do a good job of clustering news stories according to topic, they leave the reader without information about which stories figure prominently in political discourse. BLEWS uses political blogs to categorize news stories according to their reception in the conservative and liberal blogospheres. It visualizes information about which stories are linked to from conservative and liberal blogs, and it indicates the level of emotional charge in the discussion of the news story or topic at hand in both political camps. BLEWS also offers a 'see the view from the other side' functionality, enabling a reader to compare different views on the same story from different sides of the political spectrum. BLEWS achieves this goal by digesting and analyzing a real-time feed of political-blog posts provided by the Live Labs Social Media platform, adding both link analysis and text analysis of the blog posts.</blockquote>

  <h2>Ushahidi for the iPhone</h2>
  <p>Update: The Ushahidi team has released a strong new open source iOS codebase. </p>

<p>After a few months of work, we have gotten a new wireframe of the mobile app running on the iPhone. </p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.ushahidi.com/images/buttons/ushahidi_button4_170.gif" alt="Ushahidi: Crowdsourcing Crisis Information" /> Lately I&#39;ve been volunteering a little bit for <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a>. Ushahidi is an open source tool for monitoring crises and disasters. It recently won the the <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2008/05/30/winning-the-netsquared-challenge/">NetSquared challenge</a> and was called one of the top startups to watch in the MIT Technology Review. Man, I really don&#39;t have to give up anything to work on this one -- it&#39;s really a top notch operation going on. Other nonprofit and open source teams could learn a lot from the Ushahidi project. </p>

<p>Some of the amazing things about the Ushahidi project include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Participatory design. Everyone is invited to comment on these designs and <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_v3b.psd">hack on the psd files we created</a>.</li>

    <li>Rapid prototyping. (Really rapid: the first version of the app was built in a weekend.)</li>

    <li>The application is completely open source. </li>

    <li>It's a platform, not a web application: you can get the code and extend it for your own uses.</li>

    <li>Strong user-centered design principles.</li>

    <li>Great attention to detail in the design and insistence on top-notch interfaces (including the marketing website and the admin pages of the application).</li>

</ul>

<p>Anyway here&#39;s the latest mockup. Here&#39;s the latest<a href="http://http://unthinkingly.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_v3b.psd">source PSD</a>. It&#39;s v0.2 and still has a long way to go. We did the iPhone app first and will be using lessons learned from this one to port the project to other platforms. </p>

<p><a href="#"><img src="http://whiteafrican.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ushahidi_iphone_v02a-500x310.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I did most of the sketching and developed the concepts that were flying around, and then my man Joe Jones did all the real work in Photoshop. It&#39;s been a really fun time so far and I am looking forward to implementing some of the changes being discussed on the <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi blog</a>.  </p>

  <p>Most of the gang at <a href="http://boltpeters.com/">Bolt | Peters</a> went to <a href="http://www.baychi.org/">BayCHI</a> tonight, and I was really impressed by a presentation from Yahoo about <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/">BOSS (Build your Own Search Service)</a>. </p>

<p>Turns out that, once you get beat badly by Google, you start to get really open. Nice. </p>

<p><img src="/images/boss.gif" /></p>

<p>Basically BOSS (bad name, great tool) means that, with a minimal contingency of programmers, you can get a completely custom search running, and apparently you can even manipulate the rankings algorithm. Currently Yahoo is running it without requiring ads or anything. Exciting. </p>

<p>What a great way for a big conservative company to innovate -- just let hackers go to town on your fancy database and algorithms. I can&#39;t wait to see what comes out of it. </p>

  <h2>Mozilla, The AP Aurora Concepts, and Open Source UX Design</h2>
  <p>Today Adaptive Path, the godfather company of the interface and experience research industry, released the first of some amazingly high quality <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/aurora/">concept videos</a> about the web browser of the future. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really impressed, even though I spent most of the day grousing about some of the details of the interface they showed -- my nitpicking is really just evidence of how much detail there is in the video.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the real importance of the videos is not specific to any of the UI details — it&#39;s about what&#39;s happening at Mozilla, and the new inclusive approach they are taking to visual and experience design. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t put it better than <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2008/08/04/open-source-design/">Dan Harrelson did this week</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Joining an open source software project usually requires one thing: the ability to cut code. If you live in the world of functions, methods, Git, SVN, and SQL, you'll find many a friend in open source. If you instead work with Photoshop, wireframes, sketches, and stickies, you'll find it is a bit of a challenge to join an open source project. The community of developers has a history of shunning anyone who is a not programmer. Plus, open source software projects are not heavily promoted in the design community.</blockquote>

<p>UPDATE: My buddy <a href="http://hook.org/">Andy</a> pointed me to the <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-the-concept-series-call-for-participation/">Mozilla call for participation</a>, which does a great job of summarizing the initiative. </p>

<blockquote>Today we're calling on industry, higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the Web. <strong>You don't have to be a software engineer to get involved</strong>, and you don't have to program.

  <h2>Visualizing Human Rights with the Google Charts API</h2>
  <p>Smartly presented information is a nonprofit&#39;s best friend. If you can&#39;t communicate the problem, no one is going to give a damn. <a href="http://whiteafrican.com/?p=1081">Hash&#39;s blog</a> just pointed me to some powerful charts Sokwanele mapping project , which I&#39;ve mentioned <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/2008/04/11/zimbabwe-election-watch-map/">previously</a>. These charts are extremely important data to have in the public domain, and it&#39;s great that they 
appear well-executed and polished, with a high resolution of visual information. </p>

<p><img src="/images/charts.gif" title="google charts" alt="pretty charts, not so pretty data."/><h3 class="caption">Google Charts from Sokwanele and Mobile Researcher</h3></p>

<p>The charts at <a href="http://www.populi.net/mobileresearcher/">Mobile Researcher</a> also caught my eye recently (also pictured, at right and bottom). Turns out they were both made with Google Charts. I hadn&#39;t used it before, but I recognized their densely set labels and had some vague ideas that there was a Ruby wrapper. And I just thought that the Mobile Researcher charts were really beautiful. Turns out it&#39;s super easy. There are plenty of libraries for managing the requests to the API, and, in some simple cases you can even code it by hand, since all of the code is simply passed through a query tag on an image url. <blockquote class="small">What it does do is proved fodder for organizations inside and out to make an even stronger case against this repressive regime.
<span class="attribution">- Erik Hersman @ <a href="http://whiteafrican.com">whiteafrican.com</a></span></blockquote>But in most of the cases the data is hashed somehow with javascript, since urls can only be so long. Since I was working in a Rails  app, I used <a href="http://googlecharts.rubyforge.org/">a great ruby library</a> and was up and running very quickly. I wholeheartedly recommend them anytime you need simple, sharp graphics to illustrate your research. If you have a web app or with dynamic charts, it&#39;s a no-brainer, since generating images is relatively intensive memory-wise.</p>

<p>All this is to say that something like this: </p>

<pre>
  <code>&lt;img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chd=t:6,2,6,4,2,4,7,3,4,2,3,4 &chco=0077CC&chs=120x40&cht=ls" /&gt;;</code>
</pre>

<p>Turns into this: </p>

<p><img src="/images/spark.png" alt="sparkline" class="fullwidth"/></p>

<p>Or you can abstract the access to make it easier with a library like <a href="http://googlecharts.rubyforge.org/">this</a> with a method like this:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    #usage
    google_pie('val1', 'val2', 'val3')
    #method
    def google_pie(*args)
    size = "250x100"
    url  = "http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?"
    return < img src=\"#{Gchart.pie_3d( :background => 'E9E7DD', :size => '300x80', :data => *args)} \" />
    end
  </code> 
</pre>

<p>But the API of course is language neutral, and I am sure it would be just as easy in most any language. Oh, and it&#39;s free! (Though capped at <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">10k charts per day</a> ... which would be a good problem to have, I suppose.) </p>

  <p>Intel produced this fantastic map yesterday at the <a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/5167/intel-research-day-showcase-for-creativity">2008 Research@Intel Day</a>. Red countries have higher rates of technology adoption. This is really valuable data for thinking about how to influence the adoption of technology, and for thinking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_Communication_Technologies_for_Development">ICT4D</a> political spectrum in more than two shades of grey (or red and orange I guess). I think anyone who reads about this kinda stuff already has some vague map like this in their head. The only real surprise is how slow, relatively, the US is (I guess South Africa being flat is a surprise too). But the country-by-country resolution here adds such a valuable data point to the conversation about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_of_the_Pyramid">BoP</a> and the overall role of technology in the developing world.  (It&#39;s also a pretty damn good crystal ball on the future distribution of economic development). I want one for my wall.</p>

  <p>It&#39;s been a good book month for interface geeks and IXD/UX people. Congrats to AP on the new book and kudos especially to upstart publisher Rosenfeld for the innovative stuff they are doing, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Subject-Change-Creating-Products-Uncertain/dp/0596516835/ref=tag_tdp_sv_edpp_i">user testing of their 500-page, large font digital versions</a>. Rock on, you madcap publishers you. You&#39;re gonna make it big working like that.</p>

<p>All of these are worth buying (plus extra to give to clients): </p>

  <h2>The Future is All Android, All Open Source. And Underpants. And Ice Cream.</h2>
  <p>On the occasion of <a href="http://androidcommunity.com/first-live-images-of-fullscreen-android-demo-20080528/">amazing new videos</a> of the latest prototype, it&#39;s worth remembering that <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> (not the just-barely-open iPhone) is the future of mobile development for the masses. Especially when combined with the hardware support of the <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/">Open Handset Alliance</a> and the general propensity for open source projects to kick ass. </p>

<p>PS: where the hell is Nokia on <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_members.html">this list</a>?</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s ice cream and underpants: </p>

  <h2>The Three Simplest and Most Effective Anti-Spam Hacks I Have Ever Seen</h2>
  <p><strong>Hack zero: Switch to Gmail</strong>
This is not a joke: Gmail is a fantastic and nearly spam-free platform. Notably, you can hook it up with a custom domain name so no one knows you are part of the Goog machine like everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>Hack one: Greylisting with Postfix on Ubuntu</strong></p>

<blockquote>A mail transfer agent using greylisting will "temporarily reject" any email from a sender it does not recognize. If the mail is legitimate, the originating server will most likely try again to send it later, at which time the destination will accept it. <span class="attribution"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting">Wikipedia: Greylisting</a></span></blockquote>

<p>Assuming that you have your own email server, <a href="http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/">greylisting</a> is genius. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting">Diabolically elegant</a>, really. If you run an email server (or any server that can receive email) you are probably running the Postfix MTA, in which case their is a main configuration file appropriately named main.cf. A couple of edits to this file and you are on your way. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how this setup looks (not my graph but I have definitely seen this happen on production mailservers):</p>

<p><img src="/images/mailgraph_greylisting.png" title="spam goes away" /> </p>

<p>The really brilliant thing about greylisting is that it it deals with spam way before it ever reaches your inbox, which is the only way to go (I don&#39;t use any spam filtering on my mailbox. That&#39;s too late, especially from a sysadmin perspective (think of the <strike>children</strike> cycles!).</p>

<p>Step one: install postgrey.
<code>apt-get install postgrey</code></p>

<p>Two: edit your main.cf file. 
<code>sudo vi /etc/postfix/main.cf</code></p>

<p>Three: Then open it up and look for your smtpd<em>restrictions; add the following line:
<code>check</em>policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:60000 </code></p>

<p>Four: Reload Postfix
<code>/etc/init.d/postfix reload</code></p>

<p><strong>Hack 2: DNS Blocklists</strong></p>

<p>This one is even easier, requiring only an extra line (for each blocklist). The blocklists are Just put it right there in that same block in main.cf. I typically use four of them. (Each has a slightly different purpose and tolerance. Check out the sites to get a flavor for why they exist.) This one is actually my favorite -- it was created by the geek premier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vixie">Paul Vixie</a> and uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL">DNS lookup</a> for an extraordinarily light overhead. </p>

<p>Step One: </p>

<p>Open your main.cf file again and add these lines:</p>

<pre>
<code>  reject_rbl_client list.dsbl.org,
  reject_rbl_client sbl.spamhaus.org,
  reject_rbl_client cbl.abuseat.org,
  reject_rbl_client dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net</code>
</pre>

<p>Then reboot Postfix: </p>

<p><code>/etc/init.d/postfix reload</code></p>

<p>As with the example above you will also want to watch your mail log to make sure nothings gone wrong. </p>

<p><code>sudo tail -f /var/log/maillog</code></p>

<p><strong>Hack 3: Keep Spammers out of Your Forms</strong></p>

<p>This is really the ideal place to stop spam: before it happens. There are a bazillion ways to prove that someone is a human (CAPTCHAs ... sigh), but I think it is instead better to put the burden on the bots. </p>

<p>Step one: 
Add a hidden field to your form. </p>

<p><code>&lt; textarea name=&quot;comment&quot; class=&quot;hidden&quot; &gt; </code></p>

<p>Step two: </p>

<p>In your handler, ignore anybody that filled out that form (as robots will do). Here&#39;s a fragment in php (assumes that the presence of a errors array will prevent submissions):</p>

<p><code>if (!empty($_REQUEST[&#39;comment&#39;])) { $errors[] = &quot;No Spam please.&quot;; }</code></p>

<p>Those are my favorites, let me know if you have any others!</p>

(pssst. don&#39;t click on that flaky wayback machine link. I&#39;ve republished the article <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/?page_id=247">here</a>, probably completely illegally, for your convenience. But it&#39;s pretty depressing that this doesn&#39;t exist anywhere except for the zombieweb.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple of the best bits. </p>

<blockquote class="long">When an architect begins to define a building, he or she works very closely with the people who are buying the building to understand what the requirements are, and translate those requirements into a sketch of a solution. Then there's a lot of give-and-take between the occupants of the building and the architect in coming up with a viable solution. Usually, the architect at the sketch level will know enough not to design something that's an engineering problem. 

And if the architect does detect that there might be problems, he or she will consult with an engineer to make sure that he or she is not painting himself into a corner, technically speaking. At a certain point, the architect and the customer are going to achieve common ground. At that point, the architect turns those sketches into detailed drawings. Now, during the detailed-drawing phase, there's a lot more intense interaction between the architect and the engineer. The architect, you know, draws a span and calls in the engineer and says, how big a girder do I need to support this span? And there's a lot of detailed interaction between the two. <strong>This is precisely what happens in the world of good interaction design. </strong>

<blockquote class="long">I think XP has some really deep, deep tacit assumptions going on, and I think the deepest tacit assumption is that we have a significant organizational problem, but we can't fix the organization. Essentially, the crap rolls downhill and ends up rolling right into the programmer's lap. When the product or the program turns out to be unsatisfactory, the fingers point to the programmer. <strong>XP is very well-intentioned; it's the software-development community beginning to say, "Hey, this is not only unfair to us, but it's not productive as a discipline and we can do a lot better."</strong> </blockquote>

<blockquote class="long">"I applaud that sentiment and I agree with that sentiment, but then XP says, "OK, so, I can't change the organizational failings, so, I'm going to build my own internal defenses." I suppose this is probably better than nothing, but I'm interested in changing the way organizations are constructed. <strong>I believe that in order to create quality software, you have to change the organization.</strong> We can change the organization, and it strikes me that the assumption underlying XP is that the organization's structure is a given."</blockquote>

<blockquote class="long">
Building software isn't like slapping a shack together; it's more like building a 50-story office building or a giant dam.

Beck: I think it's nothing like those. If you build a skyscraper 50 stories high, you can't decide at that point, oh, we need another 50 stories and go jack it all up and put in a bigger foundation.

Cooper: That's precisely my point.

Beck: But in the software world, that's daily business.

Cooper: That's pissing money away and leaving scar tissue.

  <h2>On being "unixy"</h2>
  <p>Several times this weekend I used the phrase &quot;unixlike&quot; or &quot;unixy&quot; to describe applications or devices. </p>

<p>This is what I meant: 
<ol>
    <li>Most importantly, it means that you play well with others, as in the Unix concept of standard out: Whatever your application does, it is able (intended, really) to be used as the input to another application. </li></p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;It &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; mean using the command line, but does mean it has an extremely lightweight interface. There is no fade, no glass and no glow. Unix applications are true utilities, though they may still be extremely fun to use.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The scope of a unix application&#39;s purpose is extremely narrow. It does exactly one thing, and it does it extremely well.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It was built in the 1970s by ornery geniuses with beards.&lt;/li&gt;

<p>Just a quick open invitation, if you are in San Francisco this weekend: </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Changed the time to 4pm. </strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m meeting with designer-researchers Niti Bahn and Dave Tait on <strong>Saturday, April 19th, at <strike>6pm</strike> 4pm</strong> at <a href="http://www.atlascafe.net">Atlas Cafe</a> in San Francisco (in the Mission). Come have a beer with us! We&#39;re talking generally about designing and researching technologies for the poorest people in the world (the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_of_the_Pyramid">bottom of the pyramid</a>&quot;). Africa, Asia, mobile phones, sustainable change, environmental technologies, research methodologies, product design, application development, user experience ... lots of stuff. </p>

<p>Niti is a researcher, strategist and international rock star; Dave is an award-winning product designer and researcher based in South Africa. Developing world cell phone geeks, too. Check out this article they co-authored for a feel for what they are into: <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/featured_items/design_for_the_next_billion_customers_by_niti_bhan_and_dave_tait_9368.asp">Design for the Next Billion Customers</a>. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, email me, or just show up!</p>

<p><strong>Oh and, we&#39;re doing some planning for a BarCamp unconference of the same themes this summer. Let me know if you would be interested in attending or supporting an event like that. Probably Late June or July.</strong> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my Reader&#39;s Digest version, since I know you are graphing how much time you spend on blogs. </p>

<p><strong>About Chipchase, who really is a super-nice guy:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="long">
"To an outsider, the job can seem decidedly oblique. <strong>His mission, broadly defined, is to peer into the lives of other people, accumulating as much knowledge as possible about human behavior so that he can feed helpful bits of information back to the company, to the squads of designers and technologists and marketing people who may never have set foot in a Vietnamese barbershop </strong>but who would appreciate it greatly if that barber someday were to buy a Nokia. ... </blockquote>

<p><strong>About getting over your hatred of your cellphone (cursed device efficiency-obsession). This bit hit a nerve for me:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="long">Understanding [stuff] requires forgetting for a moment about your own love-hate relationship with your cellphone, or iPhone, or BlackBerry. Something that's mostly a convenience booster for those of us with a full complement of technology at our disposal — land-lines, Internet connections, TVs, cars  can be a life-saver to someone with fewer ways to access information. ... Jan Chipchase and his user-research colleagues at Nokia can rattle off example upon example of the cellphone's ability to increase people's productivity and well-being, mostly because of the simple fact that they can be reached. There's the live-in housekeeper in China who was more or less an indentured servant until she got a cellphone so that new customers could call and book her services. Or the porter who spent his days hanging around outside of department stores and construction sites hoping to be hired to carry other people's loads but now, with a cellphone, can go only where the jobs are. <strong>Having a call-back number, Chipchase likes to say, is having a fixed identity point, which, inside of populations that are constantly on the move displaced by war, floods, drought or faltering economies</strong>  can be immensely valuable both as a means of keeping in touch with home communities and as a business tool.</blockquote>

<p><strong>On the incredible value that can be provided by something so simple, like SMS: </strong></p>

<blockquote class="long">"... public health workers in South Africa now send text messages to tuberculosis patients with reminders to take their medication. In Kenya, people can use S.M.S. to ask anonymous questions about culturally taboo subjects like AIDS, breast cancer and sexually transmitted diseases, receiving prompt answers from health experts for no charge.</blockquote>

<p><strong>On Microfinance and the bottom of the Pyramid:</strong></p>

<blockquote class="long">
... A cellphone in the hands of an Indian fisherman who uses it to grow his business which presumably gives him more resources to feed, clothe, educate and safeguard his family  represents a textbook case of bottom-up economic development, a way of empowering individuals by encouraging entrepreneurship as opposed to more traditional top-down approaches in which aid money must filter through a bureaucratic chain before reaching its beneficiaries, who by virtue of the process are rendered passive recipients.</blockquote>

  <h2>Populi.net: a mobile phone-based research platform</h2>
  <p><strong>Now this is what I am talking about:</strong> A mobile phone based API for doing things like <a href="http://www.populi.net/mobileresearcher/">managing quantitative research projects</a>. Supports a <a href="http://www.populi.net/mobileresearcher/devices.aspx">bazillion types of phones</a>. Developed by a South African company. You own your own data.

<p>Now the exciting part is that this isn&#39;t just a single application, but rather <strong>a platform</strong> for application development; that&#39;s Populi.net.</p>

<p>Then there is Mobile Researcher(what I think is the first and only app thus far developed for it). <a href="http://www.populi.net/mobileresearcher/">Mobile Researcher </a>sounds itself really amazingly cool -- you develop surveys on the web and then anyone can take them with their cellphones.

<p>Quoting directly from their case study, it&#39;s obvious that there are some exciting ideas going on -- I hope to see some further news that reinforces these findings (the only thing that makes me wary is that they have no pricing information, and no screen shots of the survey builder interface): </p>

<ul>
    <li>Low cost Nokia 2626 handsets were successfully used by field workers to conduct surveys. Several field workers had never even sent an SMS before.</li>

    <li>On average, over 400 households were surveyed every day with data available for analysis and reporting before the field workers returned to the field the following day.</li>

    <li>Research staff and management were able to isolate and rectify issues whilst the study was in progress.</li>

    <li>Field worker productivity and quality was monitored on a daily basis for training and remuneration purposes.</li>

    <li>More than 25,000 households were surveyed in under 3 months.</li>

    <li>In total over 65,000 surveys were conducted.  </li>

  <h2>Personal metrics, infoviz porn & productivity obsession</h2>
  <p>I&#39;ve recently been reading quite a bit about &quot;personal metrics&quot; (aka &quot;attention data&quot;, aka your &quot;information wake&quot;). Pictured are some examples from <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>, <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/">Nike+</a> and <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> (which I used for a few days this week! My Saturday computing is visualized below.)</p>

<p>As an infoviz junkie, I have to say that I have always <em>adored</em> this stuff.<strong> But the tonight I heard a very smart person say that, prior to Nike+, collaborative running was impossible.</strong></p>

<p>Wait, really? How did we get to the point that we need a website, an RFID chip, and an iPod to coordinate running with friends? </p>

<p>And, perhaps more importantly, when did we start to forget it was possible otherwise?</p>

<p>Information visualization of this kind exudes authority and direction -- it gives you clear goals, measurable output, definitive results. It facilitates competition, reward, efficiency and progress. Sexy, sure. But so does fascism.</p>

<p>In these graphs, I see a kind of quiet aplomb that says, &quot;look, buddy, this infoviz shit clearly says that I know <em>so bloody much</em> about what I&#39;m doing, and it&#39;s very likely that I&#39;m doing it all twice as well as you are, sub-aware urchin.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s indeed an <a href="http://www.peterme.com/?p=646">air of inevitability</a> about it all, but why? </p>

<p>Is it inevitable that, <em>just because it is possible</em>, that we must practice <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/sousveillance/">self-surveillance</a>? </p>

<p>Are we really doing it for ourselves, as a form of personal empowerment? When I use <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> to track what I listen to, <strong>how much more do I become socially self-conscious</strong>, using my playlist for competitive leverage among my peers? Can I become more socially invested in the metrics than emotionally invested in the music?</p>

<p>When I use RescueTime to track everything I do on my computer, how much more efficiency-oriented and self-conscious do I become? <strong>Can I become more passionate about my productivity than my job?</strong></p>

<p>And with Nike+, does my daily run become more compelling just because it is more competitive and metrics based? <strong>Can I love the satisfaction of the graph more than the outdoors?
</strong>
Is it possible to be satisfied by the graphs alone? Is it possible to be more concerned with your attention data than to the stuff you&#39;re actually paying attention to?</p>

  <h2>Education is the only permanent social change</h2>
  <p>I&#39;ve felt for a long time that education is the most important vehicle for social change. I mean, really how else does anything actually get done? You&#39;ve got to have some kick ass teachers along the way, or you&#39;re gonna be a vegetable. And vegetabledom happens to entire societies. Watch out. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m a little depressed that I don&#39;t get to work directly in the education sector anymore -- I used to have a great time working on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_evaluation">educational evaluation</a> projects, and for a time I was a mentor. Now I&#39;m a full time geek staring at an LCD, and I don&#39;t so much ever get the thrill of seeing kids make the grand connections. (read: manipulating young minds, bwah ha ha.) </p>

<p>Anyway, just watched a great TED video from Dave Eggers. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/233">Give it 20 minutes</a> and tell me if you don&#39;t want to sign up to be a volunteer. It&#39;s a hilarious talk anyway, even if you hate kids. </p>

  <p>Very much looking forward to this Adaptive Path event (San Francisco) tomorrow:</p>

<p><strong> Street Hacks and Long Wows - An Evening with Chipchase, Burns, and Schauer</strong></p>

<blockquote class="large">How long have you been using your current cell phone? And what happened to your previous model? If you live in a country like India, China or Ghana the answer is likely to involve the vibrant used phone market and, somewhere along the line the informal repair cultures - guys on the street who appear able to fix pretty much anything using little more than a flat surface a screwdriver and knowledge.

This presentation will highlight the mobile phone hacking skills available on the streets of cities from Accra and beyond, the sophisticated ecosystem of reverse engineered repair manuals and highlight how it challenges our thinking about what it means to make, distribute our products. The presentation will introduce Remade - a phone made from upcycled and recycled products.</blockquote>

  <h2>The Future of Money</h2>
  <p>If there is anything I hate more than cell phones, it&#39;s money. </p>

<p>I mean, of course everybody <em>likes</em> money, but seriously, who wants to actually deal with it? Going to the bank, cutting checks to the landlord, saving receipts, budgeting, negotiating salaries, calculating the tip, trying to find stuff on sale, thinking about taxes ... man, I have <strong>so</strong> many more interesting things to do. It&#39;s all just exhausting, if you ask me.</p>

<p>But. As usual. I&#39;m griping. </p>

<blockquote>Imagine a world without access to banks and the services they provide - baseline services such as credit, money transfers, savings. For many of the worldâ€™s poor this is the everyday reality and it's a space where in part due to the spread of mobile telephony there are disruptions and innovations.<span class="attribution">- <a href="http://futureperfect.com">Jan Chipchase</a></span></blockquote>

<p>So, ok, reality check. When it comes down to it: A) Thank Allah I&#39;ve got enough to live on and B) Thank Jesus that I have some sort of infrastructure to deal with it in the first place. <strong>As in -- literally -- I&#39;m thankful that I have a bank, and receipts and all that crufty stuff that makes it all actually work.</strong> </p>

<p>Because a hell of a lot of people don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s Chipchase on it earlier this week: &quot;Imagine a world without access to banks and the services they provide - baseline services such as credit, money transfers, savings. For many of the world&#39;s poor this is the everyday reality and it&#39;s a space where in part due to the spread of mobile telephony there are disruptions and innovations.&quot;</p>

<p>And, Hey! Look! there they go again, those damned Cellphones! :)</p>

<p>Since this money stuff seems to have some potential influence on the future (who knew!), I&#39;m actually really <strong>excited to be heading to <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBankSF">BarCampBank</a> San Francisco next weekend, to talk about cell phones and money</strong>. With a bunch of finance geeks.  The point of this unconference is to dig into some of the newest, craziest ideas in finance technology, to &quot;foster innovations and the creation of new business models in the world of banking and finance.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping for some discussions about peer-to-peer lending a long with a bunch of talk about the future of mobile currency exchange. In general I&#39;m hoping that there are some folks there who really grok the reality that mobile phones are the most important platform for application development in the developing world. </p>

<p>In this context, I don&#39;t care about iPhones, I don&#39;t care about web apps; I&#39;m talking about paying your rent via SMS. I&#39;m talking about currencies and payment methods that aren&#39;t defined by a government or even a bank! </p>

<p>Or something. This stuff is all so crazy I get the feeling nobody really knows what&#39;s obviously essential vs. obviously stupid as hell.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I hope it will be a good conference that gets to some of the more important ICT4D issues. You really never know with unconferences. If we all want to talk about Baudrillard and Obama, that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do. (They&#39;re exciting that way. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll lead a session on user-centered design, like I know anything. It would be better than the Baudrillard and Obama session at least.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s to some exciting innovation at BarCampBank on Saturday ... maybe I&#39;ll see you there.</p>

  <h2>Happy Hosting </h2>
  <p>If you need a professional application server, particularly for rails, I&#39;m recommending <a href="http://rimuhosting.com/">Rimuhost</a> these days. </p>

<p>Their VPS plans are a reasonable deal, but, as always, the support is what is always most important when choosing a host unless it&#39;s a super small static site, in which case the big guys like mediatemple, dreamhost, bluehost are fine. (Oh and check wordpress.com if you need a free site.)</p>

<p>Just now I&#39;ve been getting really clear, friendly, (and super fast) support from Brandon at Rimuhost, and he showed me a great trick for removing a password from a ssl cert: </p>

<p><code>
cd /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl &amp;&amp; mv sitename.com.key sitename.com.key.with<em>password
openssl rsa -in sitename.com.key.with</em>password -out sitename.com.key
</code></p>

<p>Previously one of their techs was chatting to me well into the evening about a SQL issue I was having, free of charge, <em>after he got off of work</em>, just cause he was cool. and I love their VPS control panel, which lets you reboot, power down, and upgrade your RAM/HDD on the fly.</p>

<p>If you need a development and production box, they will clone your production VPS (for free), in under an hour. Fastest demo box I&#39;ve ever set up!</p>

  <h2>Kestrel update.</h2>
  <p>Things are looking great so far with this hairbrained project of ours. </p>

<p>Fabulous, actually: <a href="http://boltpeters.com">Bolt | Peters </a>is super interested in the project and wants me to work on it for some percent of my total time at work. Which is fan-freaking-tastic! Thanks BP!</p>

<p>If you have no idea what I am talking about, check out my <a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/2008/01/02/kestrel-a-simple-web-app-for-community-supported-agriculture/">last post about it</a>. </p>

<p><strong>But, in short, these are the three things that I love about Kestrel already:</strong></p>

<p>Kestrel is a web application for farmers.
Kestrel is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design">participatory design</a> project.
Kestrel is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> project. 
Kestrel is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design">user-centered</a> project. (Deeply so; as in, we won&#39;t build it if it doesn&#39;t solve real-people problems.)</p>

<p>Ok that was four. Anyway, I&#39;ve gotten so much great feedback already by email phone and comment -- and I am now setting up interview dates. <strong>Let me know if you would like to talk on the phone for about an hour.</strong> We&#39;ll be gathering feedback about the initial concept and looking at some first drafts of first drafts. Basically, we&#39;re gabbing on the phone for a bit and I&#39;m taking some notes. </p>

<p><strong>You can participate in a number of ways: </strong></p>

<ul><li>Giving feedback based on your professional experience (as a farmer, user researcher, designer, guru ...) </li>
<li>Giving feedback based on your experience with other applications for famers. </li>
<li>Giving feedback as a CSA manager, owner, or eater. </li>
<li>Giving feedback as one of my parents, friends or online weakly linked nodes.</li>
<li>Etc.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Please leave a comment or email me at unthinkingly at gmail if you want to participate.</strong> You know you wanna. Research is fun! </p>

<p>We&#39;re conducting real live conversations, not just email exchanges, <em>though email is also a great way to give feedback</em>. Also, note that, as much as possible, we&#39;ll be recording interviews; part of the point of this project is that the methodology will be completely documented. We record stuff partly just part of the public nature of participatory design, partly because we want to get as much informed criticism as possible, but also because we want to teach other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">communities of practice</a> to create a web app!</p>

<p>Dammit, if we (as a very small, active team) can build something that work really well for 50 farmers, then we probably have created something that will work really well for 50,000 farmers. </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://truefood.wordpress.com/">tes</a>, Andrea, <a href="http://becktench.com/">Beck</a>, <a href="http://chathammarketplace.coop/">Mary</a>, Chris R., <a href="http://www.rickbradley.com/">Rick</a>, <a href="http://ideacog.net/">Ben</a>, Mike, Nate and <a href="http://www.storytreefarm.com/">Anne</a> for commenting already on the previous post; we already have strong support in San Francisco, Portland and Central NC.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>In Praise of Shitty Programmers</h2>
  <p>There&#39;s this great movie called A Beautiful Mind that I saw once, and in the last few months I&#39;ve been quoting it a few times when talking about my programming career. Overall it&#39;s a great story, but the one scene that really gets me is when he (John Nash, famous mathematician) is standing in front of a class at Princeton and he puts a particularly complex problem on the board. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the first day of class, and he puts the problem on the board, and then explains how complicated the problem is. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;This problem will take some of you a few months to solve, ... for others, it will take the rest of your natural lives.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Assuming that I could ever even get into a Princeton math class (uh, no), this would be when I walked out. I would drop it and go back to something easier to BS, like a user experience research class. </p>

<p>I mean, what fun is working on things that you can never really GET? Things that you aren&#39;t born with? </p>

<p>Anyway, this has basically been my experience since I&#39;ve moved to San Francisco. As in, totally getting my brain fried by the stuff I see other programmers doing — programmers who were just born with it. I meet guys in coffeeshops and they tell me casually about the device drivers they&#39;re writing. (Seriously, he was building an android or something.) </p>

<p>And thus, in spite of really really wanting to be a great programmer, and thinking that I was pretty good at it, I now realize that<strong> I am a shitty programmer, and I always will be</strong>. I mean, I think I&#39;m probably around the 50th percentile  of programmers, but the problem is that <strong>I know about 1% of there actually is to learn in Computer Science</strong>. I am the guy who spends the rest of his life trying to figure out the problem on the board. And this was not a good realization. I actually was pretty depressed when I thought about it this way. I was just so much happier when I thought I was a l33t hacker a few years ago. </p>

<p>I am consoled somewhat by the fact that you are probably a shitty programmer too (jk jk jk), but in the last week I had three much more useful realizations: </p>

<h3> When it is ok to be a shitty programmer </h3>  

<p><ol>
<li><strong>You absolutely love it.</strong> I saw this guy walking down the street with a beat up cello the other day. And I was thinking about this problem and saying something to myself like, &quot;I&#39;ll bet he is probably in the bottom 30% of all cello players.&quot; This guy probably will never play Bach&#39;s cello suites. But of course, he was on his way to a great gig and was gonnna have an awesome time with has prog-chamber-rock outfit. With a big ass grin on his face. That&#39;s reason enough to work on some impossible problem long after everyone else has it figured out — just cause it&#39;s a fun process. </li>
<li> <strong>You bring something else to the table.</strong> If you are a shitty programmer but you can talk to people and help them collaborate, maybe do a bit of design, or do design research, or you just have a strong creative vision -- these are all qualities that are missing from some of the greatest programming minds. </li>
<li><strong>You are working on something important to people.</strong> This is the point I was making a month ago about all of the recent web standards fuss: <a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/2007/12/21/ok-nevermind-actually-the-future-is-in-the-past/">Amateurs are doing more important things than you are, fancypants. And that&#39;s so rad.</a> I mean, imagine that you are a brilliant programmer working on device drivers for some machine that counts money all day for some investment banker or something. Who cares? You can write a million programs that count a bazillion dollars and you will die really rich, but you won&#39;t DO anything. Find projects that are really important, gigs that actually impact people&#39;s lives in a positive way and you are already DOING much more important work than the most brilliant programmers (who are meanwhile busy deep in their cubicles, dying rich).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. <strong>It&#39;s not OK to write shitty programs.</strong> People deserve good software. That&#39;s part of the point: if you are a shitty programmer, fess up. Find your role on a team. But once you have crossed some basic threshold of capability, and you can build something that is useful, and usable, and you have a great time doing it ... then you can really get to work making a difference in the world with your work.</p>

<p>And anyway, being academically in the top 10% of your field typically produces completely perfect, completely conservative, crap. Right?</p>

  <h2>Ode To Ethan</h2>
  <p>The other day I referenced <a href="http://janchipchase.com">Jan Chipchase&#39;s blog</a> as &quot;almost certainly my favorite.&quot; This is patently false. I am a big fat liar when I get excited. (Chipchase is probably tied for second with a few other exceptionally cool writers.)</p>

<p>The blogger at the top of my feedreader is, really this time, absolutely, <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/">Ethan Zuckerman</a>. I got into his blog when I was getting my journalism degree and I stumbled across &quot;<a href="http://h2odev.law.harvard.edu/ezuckerman/">Global Attention Profiles</a>,&quot; basically maps of media blindspots. He was doing all of this research that combined media analysis with mapping with data scraping. Very cool.</p>

<p>When I was reading about that project in 2003 or 2004 I was totally turned on by the idea of writing scripts to create DIY datasets; I had no idea how to program at the time, but <strike> the stuff I have done with perl scrapers </strike> my whole new career in programming is directly attributable to Ethan&#39;s inspiration 2 years prior.</p>

<p>So I kept reading his blog, and it got me into all freaking KINDS of stuff, among them (<strong>this is just the stuff that I directly attributed to him, by name, and took the time to write a blog post about</strong>):

  <h2>Cellphones FTW</h2>
  <p>I am obsessed with cell phones right now. Mostly I bloody <em>hate</em> them. I haven&#39;t had one for six months, but <a href="http://boltpeters.com">work</a> made me get one last week. So since they made me get one I am lobbying to get into some cell-phone-type research, partly to figure out my personal issues with cellular voice communication, most mostly because, clearly, undoubtedly, they are the most important technology in the world: they are <strong>the network of the developing world</strong>. As a<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7106998.stm"> BBC article</a> put it a couple weeks ago: &quot;&quot;it&#39;s time that we recognised that for the majority of the world&#39;s population, and for the foreseeable future, the cell phone is the computer, and it will be the portal to the internet, and the communications tool, and the schoolbook, and the vaccination record, and the family album ...&quot;</p>

<blockquote>"It's time that we recognised that for the majority of the world's population, and for the foreseeable future, the cell phone <strong>is</strong> the computer.<span class="attribution"><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7106998.stm">The Invisible Computer Revolution</a></blockquote>

<p>My question is: where the hell are the tools for people who use cellphones in this way? (In particular, where are the banking tools and educational tools?) In the first world we&#39;ve got $600 iphones that can <em>read your freaking mind</em>. But a simple flashcard application for learning a few of the 62 languages spoken in Kenya?  It&#39;s not quite as sexy. </p>

<p>So this is the part that I am really obsessing over, as a developer. It just seems to me that there is <strong>huge opportunity to really do some huge good by, essentially, hacking on SMS</strong>. Or, sure, wait a few years and use cell phones as a <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/31/130245">proper thin client</a>. (But im more interested in the ultra ultra thin approach, something that would work with one of the classic Nokias, which are used everywhere in Africa . Design for maximum constraints, right?)</p>

<p>In the last few years I wrote a couple of posts on cellphones, one about &quot;<a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/2005/08/25/cellphones-in-africa/">the powerful effect that even a slight improvement in communication can bring</a>&quot; (wrt africa) and another about badass <a href="http://http://www.unthinkingly.com/2005/07/14/technology-for-the-poor-profit-for-the-rich/">Iqbal Quadir</a>. Oh and a technical/usability one about <a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/2005/12/20/mobile-web-design-tips-techniques-authentic-boredom/">developing +designing reliable, readable sites for really, really small screens</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, new content. Here&#39;s a fantastic video from Jan Chipchase at <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a>, a hero of cellphone ethnography. My favorite line: &quot;&quot;if you want a big idea you need to embrace everyone on the planet.... With another three billion people connected, they want to be part of the conversation. Our [rich people] relevance is about being able to listen.&quot;</p>

  <h2>Kestrel: A Simple Web App for Community Supported Agriculture </h2>
  <p>I&#39;m just getting started on a new project nicknamed Kestrel. </p>

<p>The basic idea a simple and user-centered web app that helps facilitate ordering, billing and member management for CSA&#39;s. Things are JUST getting started and I am soliciting help in doing some feasibility research as well as a basic evaluation of existing CSA management applications. </p>

<blockquote> 
A CSA, (for Community Supported Agriculture) is a way for the food buying public to create a relationship with a farm and to receive a weekly basket of produce. By making a financial commitment to a farm, people become "members" (or "shareholders," or "subscribers") of the CSA. <span class="attribution"><a href="http://www.localharvest.org/csa/">Local Harvest</a></span>
</blockquote>

<p>So far were in stage zero: Over the holidays I was brainstorming with some of my agri-geek friends in North Carolina, notably <a href="http://truefood.wordpress.com/">tes thraves</a>. (I like to say that tes is to poverty + agriculture issues as Jay-Z is to hip-hop -- a badass producer who just makes things happen.)  :) So far there&#39;s been a lot of excitement about it from both consumers and producers. 
<ul>
<li>Stage zero is lots of talk over drinks around the New Year&#39;s bonfire, basically. Check.
</li>
<li>Stage one is research about what real CSA&#39;s need. 
</li>
<li>Stage two is getting a few CSA&#39;s to pilot test a first iteration for a season. 
</li>
<li>The rest is iterating and improving based on real feedback. This is the hard part. And the fun part.
</li></p>

<p>The only real spec so far is an application that is incredibly simple and driven purely by a real understanding of the users&#39; needs.</p>

<p>There is no timeframe yet. I imagine things could take a year or so; nobody&#39;s getting paid by Kestrel. </p>

<p>Codewise, I&#39;ve done some simple scaffolding of the application, but really I think the requirements for this type of thing are simple -- the codebase is not really the issue. Just a few forms, login/out and billing. So I&#39;m not looking for help from coders as much as I am trying to garner some interest from A) the users of the application, farmers and consumers and B) people with experience in user-centered application design and user testing.</p>

<p>The goal is a management tool that would simplify the process of ordering food from your CSA, but also serve as an educational model of CSA best practices. </p>

<p>Right now I&#39;m thinking a hosted solution, almost certainly built in Rails. And of course completely Open and Free.</p>

<p><strong>The basic use case comes from my mom</strong> : she doesn&#39;t like very much lettuce in her box. Last year she got six heads of lettuce at a time. So ideally mom could just login and set her preference, pay her bill, update her address, give notice that she&#39;s out of town for a month, etc. The farmer then knows exactly how many heads of lettuce to harvest, and can keep the rest in the ground until going to the market on Saturday. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a new idea, I know. There are several in San Francisco. I haven&#39;t seen them yet. But I am sure that they&#39;re not as good as they can be and I want to put the users at the front of developing a new open source solution.</p>

<p>CSA&#39;s are great for environmental, social and economic reasons. And they&#39;re really just a lot of freaking fun. So if you are a consumer or producer with opinions about what you&#39;d like to see in this type of software, let me know in the comments or unthinkingly-at-gmail.com. </p>

  <h2>OK, Nevermind. Actually, The Future is in the Past</h2>
  <p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cometbus' title='Cometbus zine.'><img src='/wp-content/uploads/cometbus.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Cometbus zine.' /></a> I&#39;ve been following the recent debate about the future of web standards and whatnot. It&#39;s been making me think a bit about what I really want to see in the future of web standards. And I can&#39;t get this great California zine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cometbus">Cometbus</a> out of my head. (Well, ok, by &quot;following the recent debate&quot; I&#39;m just trying to find a smart way to say I read a few blogs. Every single one of which is linked to on Tuesday by <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1393/">Jeremy Keith</a>. Except this one from Thursday <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Zeldman post</a>. Zing zing. Good stuff. Read the comments for sure. Or just read my post first if you want to feel good about skipping it altogether.) </p>

<p>Anyway, lemme explain.   </p>

<p>In its essence I think that the call for better, more ambitious HTML and CSS specifications is great. <em>Obviously</em> it&#39;s crazy that we&#39;re just evolving to CSS 2.1 candidate recommendation after what, <em>six</em> years? (And I could have <em>sworn</em> we already passed the mark but, ok, I&#39;ve complained enough about it enough this week). </p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s all well and good. Things are slow. (per Zeldman: &quot;a slow bitch.&quot;) </p>

<p>Besides, really, most of us <a href="http://static.flickr.com/113/316476217_f398bd6575.jpg">wouldn&#39;t have a job if it was not for IE6</a>.  :) </p>

<p>But one of most the interesting points raised somewhere in the debate goes something like &quot;We need to sometimes ignore web standards and screw around with doing cool stuff. Then the people who write the specs will HAVE to include all these cool ideas we came up with. YAY! Bring on the browser wars!&quot;</p>

<p>I think this is awesome. Geek out with your <em>canvas</em> elements already.</p>

<blockquote> One thing I would observe, however, is that most web developers are not professionals. And this is a Good Thing. The network is good because it is made up of people, real people, who are much better at Whatever They Do than they are at creating websites.</blockquote>

<p>One thing I would observe, however, is that most web developers are not professionals. And this is a Good Thing. The network is good because it is made up of people, real people, who are much better at Whatever They Do than they are at creating websites. They write about industrial ergonomics or your new nephew or architectural criticism or lolcats. Smart stuff, stupid stuff, it all aggregates into a wonderful brown sludge and the one thing that 99% of the network has in common is that they can&#39;t write code to save their life and really they could not give a damn about about all. At ALL. And they never will of course. </p>

<p>Amid all of the verysmart talk about the need for more advanced specifications, we should remember that no one really pays attention to them. They don&#39;t even know that they freaking exist. I mean, do you care about the fancy traffic-law setting bodies that surely exist? No, of course, not you just want to <em>go somewhere</em>. </p>

<p>So the reason this whole debate doesn&#39;t matter for the millions of Real People is that people don&#39;t need to write code anymore. They just need tools to help them publish their content. And, oh yeah, let&#39;s remember that there are BILLIONS of people don&#39;t even have the luxury of doing any of this stuff yet.</p>

<p><strong>Somehow, Real People people need tools that help them <em>just go somewhere</em>. Nothing in any spec matters until it filters into the tools that real people can use, like blogging platforms, CMS&#39;s , and IDE&#39;s.</strong> So let&#39;s keep out heads and remember there is so much more to this &quot;web&quot; thing than proper validating HTML5 or CSS2.1 or XHTML2 fancy things, as good as those will be.</p>

<p>Thinking about this seems depressing at first. The issue really is about browsers <strong>and</strong> blogging tools, content rendering <strong>and</strong> content creation. The problem is even bigger than IE (which, holeeshit, <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ie-8-now-doesnt-trip-on-acid">passes ACID2</a>!!). </p>

<p>But, for me at least, it is a reminder that we already have more capability on the web than we ever could use.</p>

<p>So yeah, think of the photocopier and zines.  </p>

<p>What can you do with a fancy new photocopier that you couldn&#39;t do with one from 10 years ago? Not much. Once you&#39;ve cleared the hurdle of cheap, pushbutton printing, you&#39;ve launched yourself into a world of possibility greater than most people can deal with. You accomplish the most important part of the web just by being a great writer, and photocopying it. So I would submit The most important thing about the web is simple, powerful, ultra-low-fi communication, multiplied over and over and over. Connecting people to people. Photocopier innovation, traffic rules, W3C debates ... they just really doesn&#39;t matter to the DIY kids making zines, because, well, who CARES?</p>

<p>The best thing you could do is give people more photocopiers, and make them really really easy to use. Make em cheaper, make more of em and screw the Canon XTRZ-992834 with laminating and pink staples. Screw variables in CSS. Because lots of people haven&#39;t got photocopiers, much less telephones, much less usenet or blogspot and definitely <em>none</em> of us really have the capacity to use any of it to its community-centered potential.</p>

<p>Just sayin.</p>

  <h2>The Future of CSS is Here .... It's Just Not Evenly Distributed</h2>
  <p>In light of the <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/css_unworking_group/">litigious, melodramatic backwater that the CSS spec has fallen into</a>, I thought it would be worth writing up a teensy, non-brilliant-but-incredibly-useful DIY hack for stylesheets.</p>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/future-is-now-slate.jpg' alt='The future is now' />In my mind, there is really no way of getting around CSS if you are working on the web. CSS makes your site ugly or beautiful, rendering a site in just a split second of processing right before your retinas pass information to your brain. I love it; it&#39;s one of my trustiest tools. Back in the day I did enough hard time with tables and inline FONT and MARGIN stuff that CSS really was a revelation for me.</p>

<p>So yeah, CSS, I love you, even if you are spooky and crusty and awkward sometimes. And did I mention annoying? Ok sometimes REALLY annoying. ... Sometimes it&#39;s late, stuff&#39;s completely hosed by SOMETHING in this bloated stylesheet, and I realize that I&#39;ve just learned to survive on CSS island with a sturdy coconut helmet and strong superstitions about absolute positioning or a negative margin or that extra wrapper div.</p>

<p>That&#39;s mostly Microsoft&#39;s fault, but besides all the browser bugs, it&#39;s really a pretty dumb language. Seriously, what does it take to do a just bit of real vertical positioning without total hackery? And aren&#39;t computers good at this whole MATH thing? So why can&#39;t I do <code> p { width:(100% - 40px);}</code></p>

<p>Huh? I&#39;m talking to you, CSS. I would break up with you if my salary didn&#39;t depend you. </p>

<p>ANYWAY, there&#39;s a good open source philosophy that goes something like &quot;don&#39;t bitch without a better idea&quot; so here&#39;s three issues that have a solution that I&#39;d like to humbly point out actually have an existing solution. </p>

<h2>First, The Solution:</h2> Parse your stylesheets on the server! You can do this in all kinds of languages and frameworks. Hell, you could even do it client-side with javascript if you really wanted to, but for my purposes I'm banging on Ruby on Rails and have fallen in love with the <a href="http://blog.airbladesoftware.com/2006/12/11/cssdryer-dry-up-your-css">CSS Dryer Plugin</a> which processes the stylesheet dynamically with ERB. (NOTE: READ THAT THERE FULL POST BEFORE JUMPING IN, COWBOY. There's an important bug with comments in blocks.) 

This is decidedly a Not New Idea. But for some reason it's Just Not Done among most of the developers I work with, who I guess are probably also wearing coconut helmets and carrying around good luck charms. 

And, let me tell you, this is decidedly one hack that I no longer am without. As long as you are already proficient with CSS it takes about an hour to figure it out, and then you will never look back. Seriously. This is a good one. I don't often write much technical stuff here.

Here are the gigantic CSS annoyances that server-side CSS parsing solves for me:

<h2>Problem 1: No Variables!</h2>

<p>This is a trivial problem really when you start parsing your stylesheet. Most useful for setting a few color variables at the top of the sheet, then you can swap out pallets sitewide. Whiz Bang! Reason enough.</p>

<h2>Problem 2: Ridiculous Redundancy</h2>

<p>A decent stylesheet has some degree of scope, which makes your stylesheet more readable and your styles most contextual. That is, instead of just saying <code>p {color:fuchsia;}</code> it really is best to have something more specific like <code>div.column p {color:fuchsia;}</code>. But then when you have to repeat the contextual selector (the stuff in front of the p element) every time. So CSS Dryer lets you turn this: </p>

<p><code>
    body#homepage div.column p {color:fuscia;}
    body#homepage div.column p span {color:black;}
</code></p>

<p>into this: </p>

<p><code>
body#homepage 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; div.column {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  p {color:fuscia;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; span {color:black;}
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}
}
</code></p>

<p>WOOO! This is completely DRY code that renders into exactly the same thing as above before it hits the browser. So this example actually adds a few lines, sure, and it looks more complicated at first, but trust me, this is MONEY. On a stylesheet for a decent size application I ended up with about 25% fewer lines. This is great and all, but the real benefit of having every style nested in its proper context is actually solving ...</p>

<h2>Problem 3: Stylesheets Get Really Bloody Complicated for Big Sites and Teams</h2> 

<p>Have you ever been on deadline and cranked out a big stylesheet at 3am and then had to come back to it in a month and actually make a tiny change, only to realize that hey, look, it seems like this should work, but somehow the damn padding on this div is being set in three places, and when I fix it the good and proper way just makes things go ALL to hell and now for some reason I&#39;ve got to put <em>negative freaking margin</em> on this thing but it looks right so I guess I better get back to real work? I hate that. I write bad CSS. A lot. I&#39;m busy and dumb. And it&#39;s maybe that I&#39;m just distractible and impatient but dammit I&#39;m gonna blame it on the fact that this stylesheet is HUGE and I&#39;m tired and I can&#39;t Firebug this page enough to find all the relevant styles. You could also blame it on the other dorks on your team who don&#39;t use the same organizational rules that you&#39;ve been using for years. Blame it on you ex-girlfriend. I don&#39;t care. Cause nested CSS fixes this junk COLD. Take an afternoon and rewrite the project you&#39;re on with nested CSS and you will have a stunning beauty of a stylesheet in which EVERYTHING has it&#39;s place. You feel like a samurai when you come back in a month. That style is set in ONE place. It won&#39;t save you from IE, but you feel like you&#39;re back in touch with the craft.</p>

<p>GUY #0: (in hushed tones) ... &quot;So we&#39;ve got these great new offices in San Mateo and a great team, I really think you&#39;d be super interested in working with us. Kaleb says you&#39;re just ACE and that&#39;s all I need to know. This coffee IS the interview. ... We need someone ACE for this infrastructure cause we&#39;re planning on tens maybe HUNDREDS of thousands of users. Fast.&quot;</p>

<p>GUY #1: ... &quot;You know, I just turned down an offer at Facebook even though it sounds a little exciting on account of the options.&quot;</p>

<p>GUY #0: &quot;Well, we&#39;ve got this designer and she&#39;s great. Asian. And, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>Guy #1:  &quot;hot.&quot;</p>

<p>Guy # 0: &quot;Yeah, hot.&quot;</p>

<p>Guy #1:  &quot; Yeah so anyway I told them, sure  I&#39;d love to be a facebook engineer, but you know I think this stage of my life is about INNER pleasures. My accountant said I made 175 this year just managing what I have.&quot;</p>

<p>Guy #0: &quot;We can&#39;t match that. But don&#39;t you want to feel empowered, on a smaller team? You don&#39;t want to retire at 40, do you? Six hour days -- no problem.&quot;</p>

  <h2>Move to San Francisco. Now.</h2>
  <p>Since this seems to be the advice that I&#39;ve been giving to pretty much all of the geek + activisty folks that I know, I figured it bears repeating here: Move to San Francisco. Now.</p>

<p>There have been really great conferences like <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a> and <a href="http://compostmodern.org/">CompostModern</a>, green <a href="http://greendrinks.org/">socialite stuff</a> and <a href="http://www.greenfestivals.org/">Green Fest</a>, a great cycling scene, gorgeous coastline, sustainable agriculture galore, municipal freaking <em>composting</em>, local beer/coffee/chocolate/veggies/everything, the legendary queer scene, the legendary political art scene, an awesome, active <a href="http://www.aiga.org/">AIGA</a> chapter, killer public transport, a hilarious mix of psychedelic and high-tech history... It&#39;s all been even more incredible than I&#39;d hoped. This city is just completely alive and thriving with all kinds of brilliant geeky people doing Good Things. ... You should come, really. </p>

<p>I got here sometime in the summer for a new job doing design/programming/research at this fantastic little <a href="http://www.boltpeters.com/">UX shop</a>. It was completely serendipitous how I got the job, but that&#39;s a better story told in a bar than a blog. I&#39;ve got a little studio off of <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/traveler/guide/sf/neighborhoods/mission_24th.shtml">24th Street</a> in the Mission, which is about as wonderful as city living can be, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Best of all, when I moved I got rid of my damned phone and car, two of my least favorite things in the world. :) </p>

<p>For the last month I&#39;ve been working intensely on a complete rewrite of a research tool called <a href="http://ethnio.com">Ethnio</a>. Ethnio is intended to make online user experience research cheaper and easier, and I&#39;m pretty damn happy with the progress that we&#39;ve made. I&#39;ll post a link as soon as we&#39;re out of private beta. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been spending most of my day&#39;s working with a few geniuses at <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> down on Market Street (including rails expert <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/">josh susser</a>.) I love being around people that are much smarter than I am; it makes learning impossible to avoid. And this happens positively <em>all the time</em> in SF. Seriously, I&#39;m in a Valencia street coffeshop now and I could probably ask the guy sitting next to me for help with the code I&#39;m working on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be posting some more technical things here soon from my Ruby on Rails adventures, as well as some of the incredible graphic design stuff that I&#39;ve been stumbling onto lately. I&#39;m hoping to get back into blogging more now that things have calmed down with the move and with the beta release of Ethnio. But regardless, really, you should do yourself a favor and figure out how to uproot yourself for California. Come by get a beer and a burrito sometime, won&#39;t you?</p>

  <h2>The Joy of e-waste</h2>
  <p>Recently I&#39;ve been really worked up about all these computers in the closet. It&#39;s a bunch of junk. </p>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/picture-4.thumbnail.png' alt='Monitors in the office. Akk.' /></p>

<p>A bunch of dot-com-bubble bullshit that never needed to be purchased in the first place.  I&#39;ve been stressed out about that festering backwater of old computers since I got my job here 16 months ago.</p>

<p>For 16 months, I worried that it would all be super expensive to recycle.</p>

<p>For 16 months, I worried that it wouldn&#39;t be recyclable at all.</p>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/picture-1.png' alt='More crapola.' />  I worried because it was all crappy Pentium II processors and Pre-OSX Apples and janky Sun workstations. Stuff our design and programming team would <strong>never</strong> touch (nose upturned). Not to mention the 105-pound rack-mounted servers. All of it full of toxic heavy metals. Not to mention the steaming pile of three button Sun mice and a giant nest of serial cables. And the 39 (!) keyboards.</p>

<p>Seriously, this stuff has been sitting around for years. It obviously must be some sort of corporate psychic baggage. Worse, I&#39;ll bet most everyone reading this blog also has some secret e-waste laying around. We&#39;re a web design shop, but every office I&#39;ve ever worked in has at least one generation of &#39;puters laying around.</p>

<p>Taking a clue from <a href="http://ecoiron.blogspot.com">Ecoiron</a>, a great blog of green hardware issues, recently bought the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Made-Break-Technology-Obsolescence-America/dp/product-description/0674022033">Made to Break: Technology and Obsolescence in America</a> by historian Giles Slade. It has been pretty great so far, mostly string of amusing primary sources.
<blockquote>
&quot;Americans threw out 315 million computers in 2004, and 100 million cell phones in 2005. Most were still usable, and all contain permanent biological toxins (PBTs). Electronic trash, or e-waste, is rapidly becoming a catastrophic problem. To understand how we ended up in this alarming predicament, Slade recounts the fascinating history of American consumer culture and the engineering of our &quot;throw-away ethic.&quot;

</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/slade.jpg' title='Made_to_break'><img src='/wp-content/uploads/slade.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Made_to_break' /></a> </p>

<p>Perhaps a real review will be in order if I ever actually read the entire thing, which is rare these days. For now perhaps I will just note that this book was one of the primary reasons for <a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/2007/06/15/genocide-vs-gadgets/">not getting an iPhone</a>. One less Blackberry that has to die in a desk drawer.</p>

<p>Anyway, about all those computers in the office. I was really just nervous about taking it all to the dump and feeling like a complete earth rapist or something.</p>

<p>But in the end, what did it take to get rid of them?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out, not a three-day excursion to the landfill. And we didn&#39;t have to participate in some ill-conceived plot to ship it all to the developing world.</p>

<p>We just took pictures and listed it on  Craigslist.</p>

<p><strong>And 90% of it was gone in 24 hours. To people who were <em>delighted</em> to have it. </strong></p>

<p>The moral of the story: give it away now. Even if you think it is too old to use, give it away. And then think twice about that new gadget. There is joy to be had in your ewaste. Reuse is cathartic.</p>

  <h2>Genocide vs. Gadgets</h2>
  <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/idistract_900px.jpg' title='iDistract'><img class="block" src='/wp-content/uploads/idistract_500px.jpg' alt='iDistract' /></a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen gadget hype reach the levels that have been achieved by the iPhone. And I&#39;ve never been so caught up in it myself. After visiting <a href="http://www.eyesondarfur.org/">eyesondarfur.org</a> I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m giving my iPhone budget to <a href="http://www.eyesondarfur.org/">Amnesty International</a>: $50 a month over the next year.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming">culture jamming</a> spirit I spliced an iPhone ad into one of the arresting images from the book <a href="https://secure3.ctsg.com/amnestyusa/store/viewProduct.asp?cookietest=1&From=%2Famnestyusa%2Fstore%2FviewProduct%2Easp&Product=600&CategoryName=New+Products&CategoryId=11">Darfur: Twenty Years of War and Genocide in Sudan</a>. I&#39;m not anti-iPhone in particular: I just want to remind folks (<em>especially</em> myself) that there are more important things to focus on than the gadgets being thrust in your face. </p>

<p>If you have the luxury of a budget for consumer electronics, why not consider putting just a percentage of it toward something like an anti-genocide campaign? </p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>Wanted: An open-source, user-centered touchscreen platform</h2>
  <p>There has been a lot of excitement recently around a couple of developments in touch screen interfaces:  First there was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcKqyn-gUbY&mode=related&search=">insane presentation at TED 2006</a>. Secondly, of course, the iPhone made everyone all hot in the pants for it&#39;s touchable goodness.</p>

<blockquote> In Malawi, the NGO <a href="http://www.baobabhealth.org/">Baobab Health Partnership </a>... adapted Linux to $100 touchscreen Internet appliances, then wrote a program for Opera to run in full-screen kiosk mode. The resulting terminal can easily manage the nationâ€™s health data and is scalable wherever a web connection can be made.<span class="attribution"><a href="http://www.vestaldesign.com/blog/2007/03/malawi-linux-the-fight-against-hiv.html">J. Goodman at Vestal</a></span></blockquote>

<p>Fundamentally I think that <em>touch</em> is intimate and intuitive, and clearly touchable interfaces have incredible potential, especially for the folks that haven&#39;t been brow-beaten into adapting to 20th-century conventions of computer interfaces like the QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<p>(i.e., the billions of people that will be introduced to &quot;desktop&quot; computing the next decade. See the OLPC, <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/wiki/Current_events">just launched for reals in Uruguay</a>.)</p>

<p>So I&#39;m excited about a new project at work that involves designing a web application for use with a touch screen interface. When I first heard about it from the client I was coffee-though-the-nose excited because I have been infatuated by a recent project I read about on Vestal: <a href="http://www.vestaldesign.com/blog/2007/03/malawi-linux-the-fight-against-hiv.html">Malawi, Linux, &amp; The Fight Against HIV</a>. I knew immediately that I was going to rip off the idea. (In the best open source sense, of course.) </p>

<p><a href='http://www.unthinkingly.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/touchscreen.png' title='Baobab clinic.'><img src='http://www.unthinkingly.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/touchscreen.png' alt='Baobab clinic.' /></a>Unfortunately the iOpener touchscreen used in the project is no longer for sale (it had a lovely $100-$200 price tag b/c it came with some money-making software -- there&#39;s a funny story about the <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2000/03/34977"> linux hack</a>), so I was hoping someone might have some idea about how to implement this as cheaply as possible. </p>

<p>A few criteria: 
<ul>
    <li>As open-source as possible</li></p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;Durable&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Replicable&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Low Power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low CPU resources (The machine will be cheap, with flash memory, prob.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Beautiful (in a Platonic way &lt;grin&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></ul></p>

<p>Basically I want to avoid wire splicing and flaky homegrown drivers in favor of something that is replicable and extremely flexible. I want to be able to develop a web application with an appropriate UI and let it rip. (Which will be greatly facilitated by the work of the Baobab programmers&#39; &quot;<a href="http://www.baobabhealth.org/2006/08/30/touchscreen-toolkit-documentation/">touchscreen toolkit</a>&quot;). This might not be easy given the limitations of cheap machines.  </p>

<p>So far I&#39;ve got an<a href="http://www.wdlsystems.com/modperl/view_services.cgi?r=detail&prod_num=1EBOX23&aisle_id=799">EboxPC</a> in the office (a nice, fanless machine with CF and VESA mounts for the back of the monitor) with some form of embedded Linux (we&#39;ve built a tiny Linux distro for our rural wireless network that might be usable if we can get the drivers to work with the touch screen). Looks like we can get screens for about $100 and then we&#39;ll have to put a touch screen on top. Regardless, this is still in the brainstorming phase, so that&#39;s all likely to go out the window.</p>

<p><strong>Anyway, what good is a touch screen like this? </strong></p>

<p>Well, combined with the right software, I think you can really leverage usability to do a hell of a lot:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make a huge impact in developing world healthcare like Baobab has done. </li>

    <li>Collect data easily from a kiosk at a disaster area.</li>

    <li>Setup a database-driven check-in desk at your next nonprofit conference.  </li>

    <li>Collect survey data remotely (anywhere in reach of the net).</li>

    <li>Setup a small store without an incredibly expensive, proprietary POS system. </li>

</ul>

<p>I think there are lots of possibilities given that the interface could just be so much more usable. Just looking into it briefly I found an <a href="http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg2003/0503_anderson.html">open source POS system for use in cooperative markets</a>. Brilliant. This is software that could really benefit from an inexpensive stable touchscreen implementation.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience or ideas? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be posting my findings here, along with the software design considerations that I run into. </p>

  <h2>Online banking = overdue leapfrogging technology</h2>
  <p>Seems like Paypal is one of those &quot;leapfrogging&quot; technologies that could help entire regions skip the process of developing a banking infrastructure, which apparently takes about 200 years of war (judging from how the West has done it). </p>

<blockquote class="large">Good as it sounds, it is important to note that users in all the African countries covered by Paypal, can only send, but cannot receive money.

<p>So news about Paypal&#39;s international expansion is a great development. </p>

<p>but ...</p>

<p><strong>Out</strong> but not <strong>in</strong>?! How horribly ironic ...</p>

<p>I am sure that there are major obstacles to the inexpensive, reliable, worldwide transaction of money, but it seems like exactly the kind of thing that a web-based market should be able to work around. I guess that there aren&#39;t too many open source geeks that are into high finance. </p>

<strong>6/25/07 UPDATE: I am obligated to point out that this little script has graduated from interesting to useless &mdash; thanks to the new <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/#utm_source=en-ha-na-synsearch_brand&utm_medium=ha&utm_campaign=en&utm_term=google%20analytics">Google Analytics</a>, which is hands down the best tool for understanding web traffic. And it&#39;s bloody free. You probably knew this already. But, just in case, <a href="http://www.wildapricot.com/blogs/newsblog/archive/2007/06/21/how-to-use-google-analytics-to-track-your-top-blog-posts.aspx">here&#39;s a great new tutorial</a>. That is all. 
</strong></span></p>

<p>It is a pretty basic trick to get an idea of people that are linking to your site. Just google:
<code>
link:<a href="http://mysite.com">http://mysite.com</a>
</code></p>

<p>But that is an extremely rudimentary technique for several reasons.
<ul>
    <li>You will probably get a bunch of <em>internal</em> links, which are pretty useless.</li>
    <li>You will not get a sense of the total number of links from each referrer â€” they are not tallied or ranked.</li>
    <li>You only get referrers for the individual page you type in, not your entire site. Which means that you are getting largely underreported numbers. (even <a href="http://www.yoursite.com">http://www.yoursite.com</a> is different from <a href="http://yoursite.com">http://yoursite.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>You asked, and we listened: We&#39;ve extended our support for querying links to your site to much beyond the link: operator you might have used in the past. Now you can use webmaster tools to view a much larger sample of links to pages on your site that we found on the web. Unlike the link: operator, this data is much more comprehensive and can be classified, filtered, and downloaded. All you need to do is verify site ownership to see this information.<span class="attribution"> Peeyush, <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/">Google Webmaster Central Blog</a> </span></blockquote>
So yesterday I was super happy to discover via the trusty <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/">Google Webmaster Central Blog</a> that there is a new &quot;links view&quot; in the Webmaster Toolkit.</p>

<p>The Webmaster Toolkit is a service from Google that you really should be using. It takes just a few minutes to get started and then you get lots of data, including the new link data. If you haven&#39;t already (and, uh, you run a website), <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/siteoverview">check it out</a> and you will be happy to pick up a bunch of free statistics about your site. Notably, you can also create an XML sitemap (not a graphical HTML sitemap, though!) of your site to make sure google is indexing the whole thing. And you can test your robots.txt file (important for keeping those pictures of the last drunken staff party out of images.google.com).</p>

<p>I did have a couple of problems with the data, though -- there still is no way to get a good ranking of your referrers, or a ranking of your most popular pages. Luckily, you can download the entire file and do whatever you want with it. (hooray for openness!)</p>

<p>Since we have a bunch of clients I wanted to send this new data, I took the time to write a simple perl script. And I figured a few other people could use it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s here:</p>

<p>[syntax,unique<em>addresses.pl.txt,perl]
<h3>Instructions for unique</em>addresses.pl</h3>
<strong>Prerequisites: Using this script requires that you know how to execute file from the command line (and that you have perl installed). This will only work for Mac/Linux folks (requires perl and the *nix commands for sorting). ... If you are a progressive blogger or organization and can&#39;t get this to work, email me your stats and I will process them for you.</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Download your entire external links file from the webmaster toolkit.</li>
    <li>Use Excel or something to pull out that column of external links, and save this as something like &quot;referrers.txt&quot;</li>
    <li>Repeat the above for your &quot;pages&quot; column, but name it something like &quot;pages.txt&quot;</li>
    <li>Download script.</li>
    <li>Make it excutable in the same directory as your &quot;pages.txt&quot; and &quot;referrers.txt&quot; files</li>
    <li>Run &quot;./unique_addresses.pl&quot; and it will prompt you through the rest.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong> Again, if you are working for a good cause but run into trouble, just email chris at blast dot com or leave a comment.</strong></p>

  <p>[update: there&#39;s a great new post on <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006003.html">worldchanging.com</a> about this. -cb ]</p>

<p>I spent some time today searching for sailboats in satellite imagery, looking for signs of computer scientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_N._Gray">Jim Gray</a>. The story is covered<a href="http://www.nbc11.com/news/10888165/detail.html"> here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.unthinkingly.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/jimgrayamazon.png" alt="Jimgrayamazon" height="258" width="315">The significance of using this technology to do this work is obvious. Using satellite imagery to find a particular lost person is a dramatic, symbolic moment indicating some maturation of the approach -- I can only hope that it will be applied on a larger scale in the coming years.</p>

<p>Likewise I was so deeply impressed by the <a href="http://katrinahelp.info/wiki/index.php/Katrina_PeopleFinder_Project">Katrina PeopleFinder</a> project, and I am eager to see extensions of this type of &quot;humanitarian-tech&quot; project. It just seems that there are so many people who are willing to help do data entry or pattern recognition from their home as volunteers ... not to mention the 34,153 geek-brain-hours wasted on programming .ASP shopping carts or similar byte-drivel every day ... </p>

<p>And, without being critical of the people involved in setting this up (seriously, cheers to those involved in getting this going!) I think it is interesting to note that the person we are looking for is a famed computer scientist. Besides the contextual irony -- he had a lot to do with making this search possible -- we should be conscious of the need to broaden our collective altruism. There are so many people that <em>right now</em> could benefit from having a project dedicated to analyzing their needs from above. They just don&#39;t make the newspaper when they disappear.</p>

Minus points for O&#39;Reilly implying that this will lead to Web 2.0 apps that are constantly improving themselves based on user activity.

  <h2>The Culture of Open Networks, or: Watch What You Tag</h2>
  <p>I&#39;m getting into an excellent <a href="http://www.waag.org/project/shade">free pdf</a> called &quot;In the Shade of the Commons,&quot; a publication from the <a href="http://www.waag.org/">Waag Society</a>, which bills itself as a small group of enthusiastic idealists ... with a mission &quot;to make new media available for groups of people that have little access to computers and internet, thus increasing their quality of living.&quot; </p>

<p>They sound like a nice little bunch of information hippies in the Netherlands. </p>

<blockquote class="large">"We value information as a human resource of cultural expression rather  than a commodity to be sold to consumers. ... We realize that intangible  information resources raise the  issue of a  digital ecology, the need  to understand ecosystems constituted  by information flows   through   various   media. "   <span   class="attribution">The   Vienna   Document<br><strong>In   the   Shade   of   the   Commons.</strong></span>
</blockquote>

<p>They have quite nicely put together a range of material about the fragility of openness in up-and-coming information societies and the need for &quot;intellectual commons.&quot; My favorite part of it so far is the &quot;Vienna Document,&quot; (quoted here) which summarizes a number of thoughtful progressive info-principles.</p>

<p>The lesson I&#39;m taking away is not just that &quot;information should be free&quot; (ZZZzzzzzz.... ), but there is also need for a kind of &quot;humane&quot; network design that leverages openness in ways that are beneficial to more than just a select minority. </p>

<p>For those of us who design software (which is now 99% defined by networked computing), I think this has pretty hip implications. </p>

<p>I think it is brilliant to conceptualize information, as they do, as a product of &quot;intellectual labor.&quot; In this light it becomes clearer how the information that we produce (in the context of, say, social tagging) can be evaluated as a product that can be shaped by the conditions in which it is produced, controlled, consumed and potentially misused. </p>

<p>Really, what is the most profitable thing to do with a massive database of human generated metadata? Exactly how often should we expect The Most Profitable Thing to line up with the most useful thing for real-live human beings?</p>

<p>Anyway, this line of thinking seems especially relevant to me now that I am so frustrated to discover that more than 1000 nptech tags are apparently not shown in some views of del.icio.us. I can&#39;t really blame del.icio.us for whatever is causing this, but it is a reminder that we are trusting our attention data to the databases and algorithms of a corporation with no vested interest in the integrity or proper use of our data. It&#39;s enough to make me want to start googling for an open source alternative ... but then there goes my intellectual labor being photographed again ...</p>

  <h2>A question for del.icio.us</h2>
  <p>I am still working on developing a tool for analyzing community tags in del.icio.us, but I have run into a problem that messes up the data pretty significantly. I would be interested to know if anyone has any ideas what is going on. </p>

<p>The problem is this: del.icio.us says that there are about 5160 items tagged with nptech in its database. I think this number is correct. But you can see for yourself that, if you put the pagination on 100, you will get to the last page (the first time the tag was used) when you hit the 41st page. </p>

<p>That&#39;s only 4100-ish. Are there 1000 of our entries missing?</p>

  <h2>Understanding a community tag: the history of nptech</h2>
  <p>Recently there has been a lot of discussion among the nonprofit technology geeks about the use (and usefulness) of the tag &quot;nptech&quot;.</p>

<blockquote class="large"> When the nptech tag started one of the ideas was to gather enough data to look and see what words people were using to describe, say, open source (open source, floss, foss, open source software) and then use those words to inform a taxonomy. It's a taken a long time but I bet there's enough data in the nptech tag on a combination of bookmarking systems to do a little crunching and get at some of those commonly used terms. Sort of an emergent taxonomy... <span class="attribution"><a href="http://ext337.org/">Marnie Webb</a>,<br>nptech proto-tagger</span>
</blockquote> 

<p>The nptech tag (on <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/nptech">del.icio.us</a>) dates back to December of 2004 and was created by a group of nonprofit technologists that were exploring the potential for social tagging in the community. While I have a &quot;curmudgeonly&quot; eye for Web2.0 gizmos, in addition to a deep distrust of technophilic &quot;progress&quot; ...  I think that the development of this tag is arguably the single largest reason for the current (thriving I think) state of what is commonly called the &quot;nptech community.&quot; Which means a lot to me.</p>

<p>(A great summary of the current conversation is at <a href="http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2007/01/nptech_tag_disc.html">Beth Kanter&#39;s blog</a>.) </p>

<p>Opinions abound. Most of us seem to be worked up about the efficiency of the tag. On this note there has been a lot of interesting reaction to a post by <a href="http://digitaldiner.typepad.com/gavins_digital_diner/2006/12/return_to_benea.html">Gavin Clabaugh</a>, which was critical of folksonomies. Laura Quinn of Idealware largely <a href="http://www.idealware.org/blog/2006/10/taxonomy-is-dead-long-live-taxonomy.html">agrees</a> with Gavin. </p>

<p>In this context, it seems that generally the consensus has been that 1.) Taxonomies are harder to create than Folksonomies, but they are better in many contexts. And 2.) we need more data about how to make the nptech tag more useful as an &quot;emergent taxonomy&quot;.</p>

<p>So, in the spirit of improving the tag and promoting the nptech community, here&#39;s some data: </p>

<ol>
<li>A plain text listing of every word that has been used on del.icio.us in association with nptech. <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/download/fulltext.xml.txt">fulltext.xml</a> </li>
<li>A sorted and ranked list of these tags. <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/download/nptech-tagged.txt">nptech-tagged.txt</a></li>
<li>All of the tags presented as <a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/experiments/nptech/understanding_nptech.php">a scrollable tag-timeline</a>. </li>
<li>The script that I wrote to gather the data from delicious (in perl): <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/download/community-tag-robot.txt">community-tag-robot.txt</a>. (The code is also displayed below with syntax highlighting.)
</li> 
</ol>

<p><a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/experiments/nptech/understanding_nptech.php"><img src="/images/nptech.gif" alt=" "/>
</a></p>

<p><br class="clear" />
The script that I wrote crawls the pages of del.icio.us and pulls out all of the tags that were used to describe the same stuff tagged &quot;nptech&quot;. This gives us an idea of how the tag has been used -- effectively describing the tagged links, if we assume taggers are using &quot;synonym clouds&quot;. Del.icio.us has a &quot;related tags&quot; feature but it is lame (only 10 are listed), and judging from my initial review of the data it is pretty random.  (Not really sure if I broke some terms of use or not with my script, but it&#39;s <em>our</em> data, right? And besides, the script is very polite.)</p>

<p>There are a lot of delicious mashupy-type things that show you tagging patterns, but these approaches seem somehow very passive, and not community-oriented. I mean, in general delicious is used very passively -- people want to be able <em>consume</em> more efficiently, not create some community in which greater action can be taken. Or it is just used for explicitly personal purposes, as a web-based bookmark service. </p>

<p>What I like so much about the nptech tag is that it was intentionally created to support and reflect a community (unlike, say, the tag &quot;nintendo,&quot; which may very well support a community, but it is not active in a self-critical, dialogic way.) And certainly there is a beauty, I think, in using these hyper-technological tools (which have the ability to be very atomizing and consumerist) for the sake of doing things that are explicitly not-for-profit and mission-driven. </p>

<p>And personally I tend to agree with <a href="http://www.zenofnptech.org/2007/01/tagging_discuss.html">Michelle Murrain</a> that we need to be wary of an &quot;expert&quot; approach to developing our tags and community taxonomies. That line of thinking is what made me want to do this in the first place. (Likewise I need to point out how much I have really been thinking lately about stuff that I have been reading at Ulises Ali Majias&#39; blog like <a href="http://ideant.typepad.com/ideant/2006/08/confinement_edu.html">this</a>.)</p>

<p>Anyway, further experimentation (graphs/charts from excel would be easy using the text files, for instance) would be nice; please let me know if you are doing something interesting with the data. I&#39;m hoping that this will help us, as a community, determine what we want to do with this tag now that we have been using it for more than two years. What patterns do you see in the data? What does the nptech tag mean for our community? I am not going to try to start doing any analysis here, now -- but I would really like to hear what people&#39;s reactions to the tag timeline are. </p>

<p>There are still a lot of holes in this data that I could answer with a bit more programming. (i.e., who has been using the tag?) Suggestions for extending the script are welcome. What do we want to know?</p>

  <h2>The Linux Desktop in 2007</h2>
  <p>Linux and open source computing is going to have a great 2007. In spite of a few hiccups in some communities, and the astonishing lack of penetration into the mainstream brain, it is obvious that we are seeing more and more people getting it. </p>

<p>Just check out IBM&#39;s <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/linux/integration/">Linux praise page</a> if you want an overview. And governments are getting it too, in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/01/14/korea_migrates_120k_civil_servants/">Korea</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-08-30-011-26-NW-LL-PB">Venuzela</a>, and <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=138464">India</a>.

<blockquote class="large">When you think of Windows server, you think of rebooting the server, of always having to apply security patches. You think of viruses ... Linux and Solaris prove to be a lot less headaches than any other platform.<span class="attribution">Amy Niersbach,<br />Chicago geek-honcho</span></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it is a bunch of elitist BS to pretend that the only reason people don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; desktop Linux is because they are just ignorant -- Linux is hard. Switching is hard-ish. </p>

<p>These governments are not doing something that is totally obvious -- they are, but contrast, pioneers, and they are taking no small risk in putting Linux desktops in front of their municipal employees. I mean, really, I just can&#39;t see <em>my</em> Dad using ifconfig to fiddle with his network settings. Only recently has Linux distributions emerged that I would consider suggesting to my family, much less my family&#39;s coworkers. </p>

<p>(By contrast, of course, Linux as a <em>server</em> platform has had success for so long, and open source software is <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">clearly dominant</a> on the server.)</p>

<p>Ever since the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> campaign began a couple years ago, we have all seen how much it makes sense (in terms of attracting an audience) to focus on getting things to Just Work on a <em>personal computer</em>. Ubuntu has ridden the hype skyrocket right past Debian and Suse etc ... well, because they have a millionaire at the wheel ... but also because they have taken on the closed-source OS&#39;s head-on with regard to <em>usability.</em> They put a lot of time into making a Linux distribution that would recognize your iPod (and monitor and printer and keyboard ...) the first time you plugged it in. They even have a branch devoted to a kid-friendly version, <a href="http://www.edubuntu.org/">edubuntu</a>. And they have done a <a href="http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2006/01/01/breezy">lot of steady work</a> to make a more useable experience generally (even if they aren&#39;t rewriting the Gnome desktop). I think their <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">whole approach</a> deserves applause, despite all the remaining gotchas of linux. (Certainly there is not a Linux desktop the tops the Mac OS usability experience, in my opinion.)</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>Low-Bandwidth user experience</h2>
  <p>I make websites, and I manage a few web servers. Making sure that pages load quickly is a pretty fundamental part of my job. </p>

<p>Lately I have been thinking a lot about how much more important this concern is for people who are in low-bandwidth  environments (my house in rural NC), and especially in what you might call &quot;ultra-low bandwith&quot; places, where issues like cost or a lack of reliable power compound the issue by an order of magnitudes.</p>

<p>I am thinking about how web developers can become more invested in the ultra-low-bandwidth user experience.  </p>

<p>When it comes to bandwidth, international bloggers are <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/found/?cof=FORID%3A9&q=bandwidth&btnG=Search+%C2%BB&cx=000932313665553177304%3Adg67ra11mvs#1035">talking about something totally different</a> compared the &quot;optimization&quot; issues that web developers are fussing over. </p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/">Yahoo User Experience blog</a> has just posted a really interesting analysis of page load time optimization techniques. But it occurs to me that the audience that they are writing for is largely the elite of the internet -- they are trying to save a few tenths of a second. They are tuning a product, not really thinking about ultra-low-bandwidth situations. Which is fine, that&#39;s why they exist I guess. </p>

<p>I mean, It&#39;s web development 101 that you need to make you pages small. Load time is the number one element in usability. Even with that fancy DSL line, you appreciate pages that function in 1/10ths of a second instead of 2 or 3 seconds.  I&#39;ll take it. And I am glad that they Yahoo folks are doing this great research. </p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/28/performance-research-part-1/">a November post</a> made me think about my techniques a bit differently -- they pointed out that having a low-weight page is nice, but the speed experience is much more greatly affected by the <strong>number</strong> of elements on the page. An understanding of <a href="http://rescomp.stanford.edu/~cheshire/rants/Latency.html">latency vs. bandwith</a> makes this point even clearer, once you consider it.</p>

<p>Today they published an even more interesting look at the browser, focusing on the fact that browser caching appears to only be utilized in about 20% of browsers! As a developer there is no way to force a user&#39;s browser to cache data, which could easily reduce page load times by about 3x, depending on the content being served, mostly because of the point above: you save the most time by reducing the number of http requests altogether.</p>

<p>For me this immediately made me think that this is a technique that should be built into any browser that gets used in a low-bandwidth environment ... but I bet that there are innumerable browsers installed in that do not take advantage of this feature, even where connections are extremely slow. Hopefully the browsers that ship with the $100 laptop (and its kind) with be caching as much as possible. ...</p>

  <h2>You Are The Enemy: "Information Rights" vs Open Source</h2>
  <p>Ever since the introduction of Microsoft Office 2003 it has been possible to distribute documents that can only be used in the way that you want them to be used -- such as limiting who can copy, print or forward the information. This type of control, however has been easy enough to defeat with a third party reader that ignores the &quot;Information Rights Management,&quot; which is really just a bunch of plain text XML, as <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196601781&amp;pgno=1&amp;queryText=" title="Cory Doctorow article at Information Week">Cory Doctorow explains at Information Week</a>. So IRM is really not about security in the first place. <blockquote>&quot;The current version of remote attestation facilitates the enforcement of policies against the wishes of computer owners. If the software you use is written with that goal in mind, the trusted computing architecture will not only protect data against intruders and viruses, but also against you. In effect, you, the computer owner, are treated as an adversary.&quot;

<p>Microsoft, naturally, would like to end the ability to use third-party readers like OpenOffice all together, and is working to develop an industry standard that will allow your motherboard to take digital signatures in order to prove that your software is not tampered with. Security is touted as being the reason for all the work, but it seems clear enough that a uber-vendor-lock-in is attractive to the Men of Microsoft.  </p>

<p>The Electronic Freedom Foundation has a typically <a href="http://www.eff.org/Infrastructure/trusted_computing/20031001_tc.php" title="EFF link">well-researched document</a> on the background of the situation, with some proposals for mitigating the vendor lock in issue.  </p>

  <h2>Linux Overview</h2>
  <p>Just found this nice, basic, summary of the various Linux distributions.  <blockquote class="large">
Linux is an operating system that was initially created as a hobby by a young student, Linus Torvalds, at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Linus had an interest in Minix, a small UNIX system, and decided to develop a system that exceeded the Minix standards. He began his work in 1991 when he released version 0.02 and worked steadily until 1994 when version 1.0 of the Linux Kernel was released. The kernel, at the heart of all Linux systems, is developed and released under the GNU General Public License and its source code is freely available to everyone. It is this kernel that forms the base around which a Linux operating system is developed. There are now literally hundreds of companies and organisations and an equal number of individuals that have released their own versions of operating systems based on the Linux kernel.
</blockquote></p>

<p>If you are new to Linux, this may help to explain a lot of the confusion in your head about the numerous versions of the platform. </p>

  <h2>Relatively Simple RSS Aggregation</h2>
  <p>I recently posted about my need for a simpler RSS aggregator. </p>

<p>I worked through the massive list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_aggregators">existing RSS aggregators</a> at wikipedia and couldn&#39;t reallly find something that did exactly what I wanted and worked. </p>

<p>I needed something that was simple, cached hourly, displayed various encodings well and worked with RSS and Atom formats. Most importantly, I wanted something I could install on my own server, and it needed to be community oriented (not designed for a single reader).</p>

<p>Most of the existing solutions on the web are hosted by a third party, and are limited in the number of feeds that they can aggregate. </p>

<p>A robust, simple option for a thrid-party hosted aggregator is <a href="http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/feed/">Feed2JS</a>, but if you want a bunch of feeds on your site you&#39;ll have to use a bit of javascript for each one. Multiple feeds get ugly fast, and if their server goes down, your scripts go down.  </p>

<p>The best hosted solution I found was <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarius</a>, which has a lovely community. I think that gregarious will take the cake sometime this year as aggregating catches on. For now, however, the plugins are pretty limited -- you are locked into a personal reader with &quot;Read/Unread&quot; tagging. (Which makes Gregarious a great replacement for a newsreader like Bloglines, but it&#39;s not good for a community aggregator where lots of people visit.)</p>

<p>If I were a better person I&#39;d just write a Gregarius plugin, but instead I&#39;ve just reworked some of Feed2JS&#39;s code (which is in turn dependent on the Magpie RSS parser.)</p>

<p><strike>You can download it <a href="http://www.nonprofitdesign.org/downloads/simple-aggregator.zip">here</a>. </strike></p>

<p>It&#39;s a index.php file with an &quot;admin&quot; folder. Drop it on your server in an appropriate directory and you should have a page that displays 15 biofuels blogs. NOTE: if you don&#39;t know what php is or don&#39;t have ftp access to your server, just use <a href="http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/feed/">Feed2JS</a> and insert their javascript into your page. </p>

<p>Otherwise edit the php file with the rss or atom feeds you want to include. It will probably need a little CSS to spice things up. You can send comments or questions about the script to chris(at)nonprofitdesign.org. I&#39;ll release another version sometime soon with better documentation and a prettier front end. </p>

<p>An example of the styled script in action is <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/aggregator/">here</a> (at the <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/">Piedmont Biofuels </a>website). </p>

<p>UPDATE: That page now uses <a href="http://simplepie.org/">simplepie</a>, which kicks ass.</p>

  <h2>Power to the People: Free (as in Beer) O'Reilly Books and More</h2>
  <p>This is where it&#39;s at folks: free programming and web design books. Make your computer do impossible feats of inhuman strength with this <a href="http://maththinking.com/boat/webBooksIndex.html">collection of languages and techniques</a>, from old-school Fortran to Web 2.0 hipster-standards AJAX or Ruby. </p>

<p>I&#39;m loving this collection and (hopefully by mid spring) I&#39;m going to gather all of my favorite tutorials for use as a singe &quot;Intro to web design&quot; document. (Round of applause for the Creative Commons license, please.) So far I have been using Google&#39;s wonderful new &quot;Search by license type&quot; feature on their advance search page, but this yields mostly just very specific tutorials.  This page just turned me on to a whole lot of ther helpful resource, even if I can&#39;t redistribute materials from the big publishers. </p>

<p>Most of the books here are just distributed online for free because they are older editions. They aren&#39;t using an Open license, except in the case of the many online tutorials that are linked here (which are typically carefully chosen, I found). </p>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/regex2_xs.gif' alt='regex' />This collection contains a lot of really great books (many from O&#39;Reilly) that just happen to be a little out of date. I tend to get real excited when I find these things in the basement of my local thrift store, so this is real exciting. I&#39;m noodling around this afternoon with a 2002 edition of &quot;Mastering Regular Expressions,&quot; which is the perfect book to find used becuase you don&#39;t want to memorize all of it and it just doesn&#39;t change very fast. In general I find that computer books are still really useful until about 6 years (or, for web design books, pre-IE6). </p>

<p>A couple of golden links for the basics: </p>

<p>The 2000 (O&#39;Reilly) <a href="http://www.en8848.com/Reilly%20Books/webdesign/css/ch01_01.htm">Definitive Guide to CSS </a> (I use this one at home. Totally comprehensive, excellent in spite of the age, and written by the CSS demigod Eric Meyer. It never has been -- and never will be -- a great reference for browser support, which adds it&#39;s timelessness.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://aha.homelinux.com/bindee/work/refbooks/web/xhtml/index.htm">Definitive Guide to HTML and XHTML</a> (I use a hard copy of this one too.  Great for looking up all those form and table tags you forget about. Written shortly after the standardization of XHTML 1.0, there&#39;s no reason I can see to use a later version for now.)</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t think I would find these for less than the $0.50 I paid for mine at the thrift store.</p>

  <h2>Combining RSS feeds and Displaying them on Your Page with Javascript and PHP</h2>
  <p>Last night I was trying to do something that I thought would be pretty simple: display a bunch of recent weblog posts on one page. </p>

<p>There is a great online community of folks in the biofuels blogosphere, and this page would give a quick summary of their myriad, nerdy, wonderful events and research. </p>

<p>So the goal is to have the title of a weblog, followed by the most recent posts, each with the date posted and a bit of the post body. The entire web page might be called &quot;biofuels digest,&quot; with a total of perhaps 30 weblogs. Often on the web you will see &quot;blogrolls&quot; that list lots of blogs, but these are usually just links to the blogs (there isn&#39;t a post excerpt) and they are almost always either hardcoded html or javascript-included from a third party like <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines </a>(see my own blogroll on the front page). </p>

<p>I&#39;d had experience with building this type of page last year, when I just wanted to have an &quot;aggregator&quot; page of all my most loved online reading. I ended up just slapping things around with <a href="http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/">Magpie RSS</a> (an excellent open source PHP class), and it worked fine.  Not slick, but fine. </p>

<p>I could have easily used a number of services that are available online for displaying other people&#39;s rss on your own page, without all the mussing with PHP. (<a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home">Feedburner </a> or <a href="http://www.feeddigest.com/">Feed Digest </a>are services that I&#39;d recommend for doing this type of thing, if you want to go that route.)  But who wants to mess with a bunch of javascript calls to someone else&#39;s server? And you get stuck with limits on the number of feeds you can run. <em>And </em>the there&#39;s the annoying &quot;powered by ...&quot; sticker at the bottom. <strong>And </strong>you&#39;d have to use a third-party RSS splicer to combine all of your feeds.</p>

<p>So forget all that, because this isn&#39;t just a wonky personal project -- it will hopefully end up being part of the excellent <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/">Piedmont Biofuels</a> website -- so  it needs to be quick and hosted on the server.  </p>

<p>So last night I opened up the latest installation of MagpieRSS and installed it on my server, created all of the necessary php for each of the blogs, and I ended up with a decent document. The major problems with this first version (using just the Magpie class) is the inconsistent treatment of the posts -- some appear and some don&#39;t -- and the improper encoding of the blogs. (I went &#39;round and &#39;round with the encoding. It&#39;s a common problem, but I couldn&#39;t get those damn posts clean.) Probably a few days in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=9384589&forum_id=12796">Magpie listserv archives</a> at Sourceforge would clear all of this up ... but the archives are exceptionally annoying, the Magpie blog is down, and <a href="http://www.nonprofitdesign.org/biofuels/news/biofuels-aggregator1.php">the first version</a> was still surprisingly slow anyway, even with the cache working.</p>

<p>So I found another solution, Alan Levine&#39;s <a href="http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/feed/">Feed to JS</a>, which is built on Magpie.  This is an excellent free (and <em>libre</em>) service that has both hosted version and downloadable script. (It relies on the magpie class, but uses javascript to display the results., giving the added benefit of having an administrator&#39;s page that simplifies some of the options for display (such as the number of posts), and it yields much more compliant utf8 encoding (no more bloody diamond question marks in place of fancy quotes). </p>

<p>The downside: there is currently no way to &quot;splice&quot; all of the feeds together before running them through the javascript, so you end up calling the js file for each feed you parse. I felt sure this would make it to slow to be usable, but I think (hope) I was wrong, even with 25 blogs on the same page. I trimmed each of the blogs to display only 3 posts anyway, so at least the compiled filesize is real slim.</p>

<p>(Actually, while I&#39;m writing all this out, I should bother to mention that there are a hell of a <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2005/10/12/rss-mixers/">lot of 3rd-party RSS splicers/combiners</a> ... but, again, they&#39;re all third party, and they seem to go extinct quickly: e.g. the defunct <a href="http://www.rollup.org/">rollup.org</a>. Most of these also have ads, are not free, or have limitations on the number of feeds, like feed digest. I was surprised and disappointed that I couldn&#39;t find something to install on the server that would take care of this  -- somebody please let me know if there&#39;s something reliable out there. This would allow me to combine all the posts and just run the JS once.) </p>

<p>So, from a programmer&#39;s view, this is a little inelegant, but the result is really consistent, and it still comes in at 8.5 seconds on 56K.  The (minimally styled) latest version is <a href="http://www.nonprofitdesign.org/biofuels/news/biofuels-aggregator3.php">here</a>. </p>

  <p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37 Signals</a> is a supersmart little company known for creating easy-to-use web-based project management tools (namely the <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp </a>suite), and they have just announced the latest in their product family: <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a>. <img src='/wp-content/uploads/campfirelogo_01.gif' alt='campfirelogo' /> </p>

<p>According to their website, &quot;Campfire brings simple group chat to the business setting. Instant messaging is great for quick 1-on-1 chats, but it&#39;s miserable for 3 or 4 or 7 or 15+ people at once. Campfire solves that problem and plenty more. &quot; </p>

<p>A little background: By day I work at a university with a nonprofit evaluation team. We work for other nonprofits that are trying (...or are being forced to by their funders) to discover and amplify the best aspects of their program.  A major part of our job is finding out what people think works well -- so we are typically creating surveys and conducting focus groups or our clients. </p>

<p>Focus groups are a great way to bring together a lot of good people and get a lot of good advice about a program. Among all the fun things we do with nonprofits, they&#39;re my favorite. But in-person focus groups are expensive and difficult to arrange, especially when you are working with busy people. Who has time to sit around and talk about making a program better? You&#39;ve too busy working on the program, dammit!</p>

<p>This problem is what first attracted me to the idea of conducting focus groups online. At the <a href="http://www.eval.org/">American Evaluation Association&#39;s</a> conference last year in Toronto, I was fortunate to sit in on a session that discussed the existing methods for doing this type of work.  All of the evaluators in the room seemed to really get excited about it: online focus groups solve so many of of the distance/time/money problems evaluators face, especially in the nonprofit sector. Some people have already been doing this with telephone surveys, but in many cases (depending on your phone company and country) this can be really expensive -- and it&#39;s unlikely to give you a transcript. </p>

<p>And, unfortunately for most of us at the evaluator&#39;s conference, the presenters were from the for-profit world, and their solutions were ridiculously expensive -- about $1500 per focus group administration. These are basically managed chat rooms in which invited participants are egged on with questions from a well-trained facilitator. This is why online focus groups have been largely a marketing research arena -- big pharma et al don&#39;t need no stinkin&#39; open source solution. </p>

<p><img src='http://www.pictr.org/wp-content/shothighlight.jpg' alt='screenshot2' />After the session I raised the issue of reconfiguring WordPress or a more robust CMS (Joomla or Drupal) with a chat feature. If you could just manage to get all of your participants together online at the same time (or over a 3-day period), you could easily solicit lots of feedback. (And you wouldn&#39;t have to transcribe the results). Folks (including focus group guru <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761920706/qid=1140644287/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-4438084-9236913?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Richard Kreuger</a>) were excited about the possibility of finding a cheap way to do this: there is a serious need for something <strong>way </strong>below the $1500 range.  </p>

<p><img src='http://www.pictr.org/wp-content/shotlocked.jpg' alt='screenshot' />Unfortunately, in my research, I that most server-side free/open source chat software is buggy, poorly designed, and horrible with server resources. I found that people were using hosted solutions like Yahoo discussion groups in a pinch, and having limited success. So, not really able or willing to create a program from scratch, I put the project on hold. The recent release of Campfire brings a number of awesome features to the under-$20 table. Here are my notes on the best features for focus groups with Campfire: </p>

<ul>
    <li>It's simple, clean, easy, elegant (all synonyms for "37 signals product")</li>

    <li>Real time image previewing (for getting reactions, for example, to a chart) </li>

    <li>You get a unique url for your chat, unlike an IM chat, so you can invite people to a web page</li>

    <li>It tracks previous conversations</li>

    <li>It keeps a record of who said what when (the timestamps are just killer)</li>

    <li>You can have secure chats (essential, I would think, for IRB approval ...) </li>

    <li>No software other than a web browser is needed.</li>

    <li>Repeat: automatic transcriptions!</li>
</ul>

<p>So I&#39;m really excited about Campfire and I look forward to trying it out, hopefully with a longer post in the near future about the existing options for online research of this nature. Until then, check it out for yourself if you need to do some group instant messaging, I think the possibilities are amazing if you just have a talented coordinator and some people that have valuable things to say. </p>

  <h2>On Teachers Moving from Web 0.5 to Web 3.0</h2>
  <p><a href="http://davidwarlick.com/2cents/2006/02/16/happy-birthday-jude/#comments">David Warlick</a> posts insightfully about the uses of technology in education. Right now he seems like a pretty stressed out guy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not an educator (though I do work in education via nonprofit evaluation). And I don&#39;t get quite as excited as he does when discussing the latest crop of communication technologies.</p>

<p>But in one of his most recent posts on his blog <a href="http://davidwarlick.com/2cents/">2 Cents</a>, I am right there with him pulling out my hair. The story is kind of funny actually, in a sick way (kind of like the way it&#39;s funny when Cheney shoots a 78-year-old man). </p>

<p>The story is like this: Warlick presented to a large group of teachers here in North Carolina recently and polled them informally about the technologies they used. </p>

<blockquote class="large">
"How many were blogging, I saw only three hands.

How many read blogs? Perhaps 20.

How many had listened to a podcast? Maybe ten.

How many had podcasted? Zero!

How many used flickr? Zero!

How many knew about social bookmarks? Zero!

Delicious (del.icio.us)? Zero!"
</blockquote>

<p>This is all really not that surprising to me. I know that two years of hype about blogging has done little to clarify its value as an fun, educational tool. And these are a particular type of hype-prone (&quot;Web 2.0&quot;) technologies. </p>

<p>And yet, really, these things are exciting and useful. Teachers would love these things. They aren&#39;t just hype. I only wish teachers knew more about these great, fun technologies that kids would love. For sure, I have seen great integrations of podcasting (AKA: grassroots audio) and blogging (AKA: networked writing) into the classroom -- and I have seen how serious critical thinking skills are engendered in the use of these technologies. </p>

<p>So I think these teachers&#39; technological literacy is unfortunate, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a tragedy, as David might say at this point. I think we are just at an early stage, and we (progressive type/educational bloggers) are impatient to show off the great strides the internet has made in recent years. Or at least, that&#39;s the polite way of putting it. </p>

<p>But when I read the following I was a little more disturbed: </p>

<blockquote class="large">
"I asked how many of them had used Gopher. About three-forths of the hands went up. This surprised me. I asked about Telnet. Again, a vast majority of the hands when up."</blockquote>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/telnet.jpg' alt='Telnet circa 1990' /></p>

<p>That&#39;s right. Gopher and Telnet are not only still <strong>on people&#39;s radar</strong>, but teachers are apparently <strong>much more familiar</strong> with these medieval implements than blogs. Why is this so difficult to catch on to? It&#39;s just writing on the internet. Where are the barriers to understanding and use coming from? I know that technological literacy and the digital divide are real complex issues, but dammit, I don&#39;t get it. Why did people stop paying attention when it got interesting? Blogging is so much more engaging and Telnet was ... just such a drag!</p>

<p>As David writes: &quot;These are educators who, in the early 1990s, were on the edge. They were paying attention, recognizing an emerging revolution in information, and latching on. What happened between then and now? Why have they missed the new revolution?&quot;</p>

<p>I hope that online communication will become much more mainstream this year. But for now I think that white-hot hype + cold, ivory-tower perspective of technologists has done a lot to keep powerful new communication tools out of the mainstream, locked in some elite computer lab. For now I resolve again to remember that I&#39;m part of an extreme minority of addled programmers and gizmo fetishists. I want to do what I can to remind people that <strong>simple</strong>, free, worldwide publishing and distribution is now a reality. And for now I just hope that educators aren&#39;t teaching kids that dial-up BBS&#39;s define the world of technology. </p>

&quot;LinuxChix Africa manages to shatter two stereotypes at the same time: the idea that women aren&#39;t interested in free/open source software development; and the idea that women in Africa are bound to traditional cultural roles. Founded in late 2004 by Anna Badimo, a computer science graduate student in South Africa, and Dorcas Muthoni of the Kenya Education Network, LinuxChix Africa seeks to build Linux skills among African women, as well as to support more generally the use of free/open source applications and systems across Africa. Like most Linux and F/OSS communities, much of their work entails professional software development and public advocacy of open source, but LinuxChix Africa adds a unique twist: they focus their outreach on encouraging young women to pursue careers in computing.&quot;</p>

  <h2>NGO in a Box: FOSS Mixtapes for Change</h2>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.tacticaltech.org/">Tactical Technology Collective</a> is a nonprofit based in Amsterdam that has been doing great work distributing Free/Open Source technology to the global NGO sector. </p>

<p>This morning I was reminded (via <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004083.html">Worldchanging</a>) that they are working on creating several different &quot;best of&quot; software compliations for NGOs-- kind of like that lovely old mixtape you have in your car, except with encryption tools, spyware tools and Firefox, among many others. And better liner notes. The first to be released was the <a href="http://ngoinabox.org/">&quot;Security Edition&quot;</a> last October (which I suppose is, um, not to be confused with the ubiquitous AOL Security Edition discs at the grocery store). </p>

<blockquote class="large">
The security version of NGO-in-a-box ... is aimed predominantly at human rights, anti-corruption, and womens groups, independent media and journalists. Its purpose is to help these groups, and those who work as trainers and technical support with these groups, to orient themselves with the kinds of security and protection tools they could use and the ability to easily access and try them out. This boxset is made of three CDs and printed manual.
</blockquote>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/ngoinaabox.png' alt='NGO-in-a-box' /></p>

<p>One of the most important parts of the CDs is the documentation, which somes in English, Spanish, French, Russian and Arabic. (Unfortunately a lot of the software only comes in English.) </p>

<p>It came as some surprise to me that the Security edition comes with a collection of FOSS applications that are designed to run on Windows (TM)(!). I think the decison to run on a closed platform (instead of Linux) was rather unfortunate ... and unfortunately necessary for now. This CD provides a lot of great tools for NGOs at zero cost -- and very few of the Tacitcal Tech&#39;s audience is up and running with an Open platform on all of their machines. I hope, of course, that this won&#39;t be the rule for future releases, but for now it seems pragmatic. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking forward to their future releases of a &quot;Base Edition&quot; &quot;Advocacy Edition,&quot;  and especially the &quot;Open Publishing Edition&quot; (they&#39;re only a few months behind schedule ...) </p>

<p>Also worth noting: the Tactical Technology Collective is also a great proponent of the E-Riders philosophy + practice. They have a great <a href="http://www.tacticaltech.org/eriding">page about eriding</a>, and will be releasing a new white paper on the subject sometime soon. There is also a good website about E-Riding at <a href="http://www.eriders.net/"><a href="http://www.eriders.net/">http://www.eriders.net/</a></a> ... it&#39;s really too bad their blog has been dead all year! </p>

  <h2>Visualizing Community News</h2>
  <p><a href="http://mikeindustries.com">Mike Davidson</a>  has been working lately on an innovative (I said innovative, not trendy) online news company, <a href="http://www.newsvine.com/">Newsvine</a>, that provides articles from mainstream media outlets. The Newsvine team is a well-respected web group, most of them formerly of Starwave, a studious anti-hype third-wave (i.e. late 1990s, post-bubble) internet company. (Here&#39;s Starwave&#39;s <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/05/starwave.html">startup profile</a> from a 1996 Fast Company article.) Davidson&#39;s also a major contributor to <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr/">SiFR</a>, which typophiles (that&#39;s typography, not typos) and web developers everywhere love.</p>

<p>The trick of Newsvine is that it comes in a really well designed interface and allows community input, both by linking and commenting. Here&#39;s an extract from a larger rundown at <a href="http://www.solutionwatch.com/305/newsvine-seeding-the-vine/">Solutionwatch</a>: </p>

<blockquote class="large">One of the main frustrations of reading normal news sites for me is how they all have cluttered sites with advertisements everywhere, news mixed around, and when I find a story of interest, I can't even comment about it. Newsvine is the complete opposite and I immediately felt at home with their beautiful interface that allowed me to easily find and read what I am interested in. The design consists of a style that I feel has the unique style of its founder, Mike Davidson. The main page gives a clear overview of all the news submitted from the Associated Press and the Newsvine users, along with buttons to vote and comment on stories (more on this below). "The Wire" being news from sources like the Associated Press, ESPN, and other services. "The Vine" being user submitted content.</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m <em>very</em> excited to see companies that understand my Sysiphean-Kafkaesque nightmare of flashy, obtrusive, cluttered websites like Yahoo! and all the major news outlets (see image). And of course I&#39;m excited to see (another) community-building website that allows for the development of local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomies </a>and scalable collaboration. </p>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/clutter_01.png' alt='Clutter' /></p>

<p>I would very much like to start using Newsvine in order to tag and collect news items that are relevant to my organization(s). Considering Newsvine&#39;s focus on usability and design, I think it would be a serious alternative to using something like del.ico.us to share links. Del.icio.us just has such an uber-geeky interface that is seriously off-putting to most warm-blooded nonprofit people. And of course, there are a number of other &quot;social news sites&quot; that are doing something similar to newsvine, including: </p>

<p><a href="http://digg.com"><a href="http://digg.com">http://digg.com</a></a>
<a href="http://www.gabbr.com"><a href="http://www.gabbr.com">http://www.gabbr.com</a></a>
<a href="http://www.plastic.com"><a href="http://www.plastic.com">http://www.plastic.com</a></a>
<a href="http://www.newsback.com"><a href="http://www.newsback.com">http://www.newsback.com</a></a></p>

<p>Digg.com, in my experience, is the best of these and has the largest user base (there are even <a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/blog/pshapiro">rumors </a>on the Digital Divide listserv from Phil Shapiro that it will soon be larger than geeky heavyweight slashdot.com. As Phil says: &quot;Community editing of news. Community. Editing.&quot; It&#39;s a huge thing indeed.) </p>

<p>For an example of Newsvine&#39;s potential, look non further than <a href="http://www.maptalk.co.nz/infographics/worldnews.cfm">this map</a> (see image), created by Fraser Mills today. In the &quot;tradition&quot; of the best web applications, developers will soon have a Newsvine API (a kind of cookbook for developers, saving lots of time) into which all kinds of fun can be had, and Fraser is just a little ahead of the curve. His map represents news items according to their location. You can click on each country and get a rundown of the news in that area. I imagine that you will soon be able to sort and filter to create some impressive maps of information. </p>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/newsvine.jpg' alt='news' /></p>

<p>Most impressively, Davidson has <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/01/newsvine-with-google-maps">written </a>today that an API is in the works and that: &quot;Once true location data like this makes its way into posts, wire articles, and seeds, the map will be even more useful. You&#39;ll be able to zoom in on Seattle, for instance, and get stories down to the micro-local level.&quot; </p>

<p>Now that would be useful. </p>

<p>Newsvine is still in beta and registration is limited. But based on Mike Davidson&#39;s previous work and the projects promising future for collaboration, I&#39;m eagerly anticipating my invitation. </p>

  <h2>Truth in a Home Page </h2>
  <p>Great advice on crafting a home page from <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/homepagegoals">A List Apart</a>. In short: build it last, and work first on the details (the smallest, ubiquitous elements of your site). A great homepage with poor search results or product page will only lead to disappointment.  So if your site is shallow and ugly on the inside, make sure your homepage is too.   Also: </p>

  <h2>Rosetta Provides Collaborative Online FOSS Translation</h2>
  <p><a href="https://launchpad.net/rosetta">Rosetta </a>is a web-based platform that does exactly what I thought needed to be done: it makes open source software translation really easy for lots of people, and it makes it easy to collaborate on a translation project. </p>

<p>Instead of having to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_2.html">edit .po files manually</a>, this web interface allows you to easily just ... translate. Read the message, type your translation, save. It&#39;s that easy. </p>

<p>Well, almost: the result still should be combed over with a something like POedit.</p>

<p>But Rosetta nontheless is an incredible project about which I am very excited, and I congratulate their team and the 8796 translators (according to public page stats) working to make free software available worldwide. I especially like logging into the website and being able to see the progress on each translation for each of the O.S.S. projects they work with. (Currently there is no Wordpress 2.0, just 1.5, unfortunately. There is also no Swahili team, prior to myself and Ndesanjo.) </p>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/rosetta2.jpg' alt='Rosetta2' />The Rosetta project is, I believe, originally the translation interface for the Ubuntu Linux community. Ubuntu is a distribution (a version) of the Linux operating system.  </p>

<p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/ubuntu.jpg' alt='ubuntu-logo' />For those who are new to the world of Open Source, Linux is a platform for your computer, just like Microsoft Windows or Apple&#39;s Macintosh OS. But Ubuntu-flavored Linux is free, community built and, indeed, community oriented. Ubuntu Linux is &quot;beating out&quot; a lot of the more traditional flavors of Linux because it is more user friendlily. I like to think of Ubuntu Linux developing enough to enter the mainstream as a free alternative to Windows. </p>

<p>From the Ubuntu website: </p>

<blockquote class="large">"Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, meaning "humanity to others". Ubuntu also means "I am what I am because of who we all are". The Ubuntu Linux distribution brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world.

The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite any disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to customise and alter their software in whatever way they see fit.</blockquote>

<p>The Rosetta project has a lot of these fuzzy overtones. I love it. I would encourage anyone with strong language skills to log in and start translating one of your favorite programs.</p>

1.) Share technical information about their experience in making + using biofuels. I would like to include references, for example, to articles in academic journals. (Using RSS syndication, this could be largely automated, and it would be as current as can be.)
</p>

<p>
2.) Find information about current local legislation, and easily email relevant legislators. This is easy enough to implement with PHP. 
</p>

<p>
<img src='/wp-content/uploads/pbwebsite.jpg' alt='Piedmont Biofuels' alt="piedmont biofuels site" />3.) The third, most important goal (though I think this has to come after the above 2) is to create a centralized place for dialogue. To do this I would like to offer blogs to each of the current biofuels operations in NC. (Though I doubt most of them could keep up with <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/blog/">Lyle "Energy Blog" Estill</a> at <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/">Piedmont Biofuels</a>.) 


We could syndicate all of their posts on the community site so you can read everyone's posts in one place. Likewise we could create a tag for use in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati </a>and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a>. (Something like NCbiofuels.) 

(Using tags to create a close community online has certainly worked well for the nptech folks in recent months, though it is easier because we're all geeks. But even if just a few people used it for photosharing it would work well enough.)

And we could also have a more traditional bulletin board for on-site conversations. (Probably using <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/">PhpBB</a>, if I have my druthers.) And I think that a really comprehensive "Upcoming NC biofuels events" page would be an important result of this online community building.

I know that all of these things are happening already online in the community, but I want to magnify and multiply the network. I don't want to replace, just republish and distribute widely.</p>

  <p>I love this podcast (and I adore the entire IT Conversations series). Here&#39;s a link and a blurb. </p>

<blockquote class="large">
The free and open source software movement is moving, rapidly. The open sourcing of Solaris has added lent enormous weight to this community based development culture. The community behind free and open source software is changing the landscape of software development and moving the value away from traditional delivery of a piece of software. What is making such communities very successful? What obstacles do they face? And what should we all be doing to ensure continued success?

Jonathan Schwartz, President and COO, Sun Microsystems answers these questions and more in his keynote address at the OSB. Mr.Schwartz, one of the most high profile corporate bloggers around, goes back in time to show how standardization and access to communication has resulted in enormous all round economic growth. Starting with the standardization of canals and railroads dimensions to a standard voltage and plug form for electricity distribution he explains how industries have created new opportunities and moved on to deliver value in non-traditional ways.

He talks about how Thomas A. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb and holder of a few hundred patents, failed in trying to protect his Intellectual Property by trying to trash rivals and draws parallels to more recent efforts of companies which try to protect their IP and hypocritically participate in community development. You wouldn't expect Mr. Schwartz to defend FOSS in anything but the strongest terms and he delivers in a manner which will gladden the hearts of this increasingly visible community.</blockquote>

  <p><img src='/wp-content/uploads/colors.jpg' alt='Colors' />Wow. Steve at Slayeroffice.com has an amazing <a href="http://slayeroffice.com/tools/color_palette/">color palette generator</a> based on the design technique of <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/creating_colour_palettes.html">Andy Clark</a>.</p>

<p>You enter a hex code value for a color, then another to mix it with, and out comes a beautiful png graphic of the color scheme. Extremely nice work, Steve. This is a great resource for brainstorming color schemes. I&#39;ve used a number of other methods, but this one gets the prize. </p>

<h3>UPDATE</h3>

<p>Ok, so the color palette generator at <a href="http://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/index-en.html">wellstyled </a>(shown)  is even better.<br>
I still recommend one extension of the techniques: take a scheme you like and use Photoshop to adjust the hue locally, and generate as many versions as you need (perhaps for clients or your boss). Then it&#39;s even easier to get ideas. If your&#39;e a new web designer, that&#39;s a good enough reason on its own to downlo ad a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/main.html">trial of Photoshop</a>, I think. </p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>Don't Make Me Think</h2>
  <p>There are very few web design books that have any currency after about 2 years. Very few.
And half of these are notable because their very outdatedness is instructive. The rare remaining 50%
of this minority of web design books is the &quot;on-every-designer&#39;s-shelf&quot; collection. Among them is certainly Steve Krugman&#39;s &quot;Don&#39;t Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability.&quot;</p>

<p>It is, he writes, a book for &quot;people in the trenches -- the designers, the developers, the site producers, the project managers, the marketing people, ... and the one man band people who are doing it themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>The rule, &quot;don&#39;t make me think&quot; is an obvious principle, but it can be translated many ways.</p>

<p>One great translation is the user&#39;s maxim &#39;the more difficult it is to use, the less I will use it.&quot; You must design for users, not yourself. Always second guess your new aesthetic vision, and, if at all possible, conduct a usability test with real users.</p>

<p>Another reformulation of the main theme is &quot;no one cares as much about your site as you do.&quot; And really, it <em>doesn&#39;t matter</em> to users if they understand everything about your site. (This is difficult for many developers, who are intensely interested in how online stuff works.) Users want to know how to use it to do specific tasks. This is the age-old (ie 1990s) principle of &quot;satisficing&quot; -- being satisfied and sacrificing. If you expect more than 10% of your web page to be read by a single user, you have high expectations.</p>

<p>The corollary to this principle is that, if a user can make your site work for them, they will stick with it. Secondly, you must respect a counterintuitive fact: it is <em>difficult</em> to make a site simple and <em>easy</em> fill it with confusing design.  I am fond of saying that web design is a process of subtraction. There are a number of helpful hints for building subtrative process into your design method:
<ul>
    <li>Create a clear hierarchy from the beginning.</li>
    <li>Use conventions.</li>
    <li>Spend a lot of time on the navigation. Harness the power of links by focusing your design energy on that navigation bar.</li>
    <li>Remove words: Take out that useless banter.</li>
</ul>
Steps designed to ensure hierarchy, conventionality, easy navigation and conciseness are the basic rules of content development for the web.This is what it means to write for the web.</p>

<p>Krug also poses the wonderful &quot;Trunk Test of Web Usability&quot;:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. Print your page.</li>
  <li>2. Hold it at arms length and circle:</li>
  <li>a. The site name</li>
  <li>b. The sitewide search box</li>
  <li>c. The sitewide navigation</li>
  <li>d. The page name</li>
</ul>

<p>Does your site pass the test? Can you easily identify the most usable, important parts of your website? Yes, this is common sense, but, again you have to be sure: can your users really use your site easily?</p>

<p>There is also great chapter devoted to designing your home page, the most important page of your site. In brief, here are a few things that your colleagues (or inner slacker) may offer as excuses to creatign a truly usable site.</p>

<p>There is also great information about working with teams of developers. Namely, stay away from &quot;religious debates,&quot;
in which people are &quot;expressing strongly held personal beliefs about things that can&#39;t be proven.&quot; Contrast, for example, opinions about Macromedia Flash, the web&#39;s animation format. Some people (namely graphic designers and CEO&#39;s) love Flash. Some (namely me) don&#39;t care for it in most situations. Arguments begin. People waste their time going round and round with the religious debate about Flash. The way out of this cycle, Krug explains, is to ask: does this use of Flash in this situation, on this site, with this content and our users work?</p>

<p>Lastly, it must be recognized that Krug always carries to flame for testing: you must test your website, Krug writes. Stop thinking that usability tests cost $50,000. They cost closer to $100, if you have a tape recorder and a computer. Get a few of your potential users and let them tell you what is really happening on your web site. </p>

  <h2>"Decolonizing Cyberspace"</h2>
  <p>I had the pleasure of spending this weekend with Ndesanjo Macha (<a href="http://digitalafrica.blogspot.com/">English Blog</a>/<a href="http://jikomboe.blogspot.com/">Kiswahili Blog</a>/<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/?p=132">Profile at Global Voices</a>) in Greensboro, N.C., about an hour from my house in the woods near Pittsboro. We&#39;re working together on a Kiswahili translation of WordPress, the excellent open source platform for this website. </p>

<p>We are fortunate to have the aid of the great invisible WordPress translator&#39;s community, which has collaboratively published at least a couple (<a href="http://codex.xwd.jp/index.php/Localizing_WordPress">1</a> <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress">2</a>) of essential how-to&#39;s. Also there is of course the PoEdit team (mostly programmer <a href="http://www.poedit.org/donations.php">Vaclav Slavik</a>, I think), which makes the software that edits the software. Do you guys sell T-shirts, or what? </p>

<h3>1 Geek + 1 Native Speaker = Native-Language Software for Millions. </h3>

<p>Any techno- or translation-minded folks please email chris at nonprofitdesign dot org. Help translate your favorite Open Source software into a new language. </p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping we&#39;ll be finished with it pretty soon, and we&#39;ll be promoting it to the 30-80 million estimated Kiswahili-speakers in the world. (Mostly in Kenya, Tanz. and Uganda: here&#39;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili">wikipedia article </a>about Swahili.) </p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I&#39;ve transferred him to a shiny <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress 2.0</a> blog. It&#39;s embargoed for now, but his new domain will resolve in a few days. He&#39;s excited about WordPress because Google&#39;s Blogger, while being terrifically easy to use -- is so limited a platform that it hurts to use. (Seriously, Google: you don&#39;t have <em>categories</em>, for god&#39;s sake. That&#39;s so 2005. The workaround <a href="http://oldcola.blogspot.com/goodies/BloggerCategories.html">hacks </a>are hideous. ) And Blogger certainly does not have the same blogger-developer community. </p>

<p>Ndesanjo has been using Blogger with great success in Tanzania for some time now, and he says that he sees new Tanzanian bloggers every day. (However, he sent me a link to a new Tanzanian <a href="http://blog.co.tz/login.php">blog portal</a>. I signed up and found an extremely small user base‚ writing in English.) But most of the Tanzanian bloggers stick to good-ole Blogger and have had to hack their templates a bit to get key phrases into Swahili. </p>

<p>Yikes. Who wants to try to figure out a content management system template on a dial up connection? With no documentation? No thanks. That&#39;s where we come in with the translation. </p>

<p>Ndesanjo recently described the Swahili blogosphere in this way: </p>

<blockquote class="large"> is nearly impossible to translate most of the poems and convey the same message. Most of the time these poet bloggers are challenging each other with creative use of complex and deep Swahili, which is an established tradition in Swahili poetry.</blockquote>

<p>So keep your aggregators tuned for developments on that front. You can read Ndesanjo&#39;s regular <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/globalvoices/-/world/sub-saharan-africa/tanzania/">summaries of the Swahili blogosphere at Global Voices</a>. </p>

<p>The CPB has long been (um, in internet terms, I mean, that being all of 2005) a great resource for finding information about &quot;blogging under fire.&quot; From their website, the CPB has several main purposes:</p>

<p>1.) A clearinghouse for information on incarcerated members of our community, as well as those whose lives have been taken from them because of their enthusiasm for the free exchange of information that blogging allows.</p>

<p>2.) A pressure group to force governments to free imprisoned bloggers, and make restitution for tortured and murdered ones.</p>

<p>3.) CPB will bring to bear the formidable communicative power of the blogosphere to keep pressure on governments to stop arresting and abusing bloggers and to mitigate or reverse measures designed to restrict speech.</p>

<p>4.) CPB will act as direct agents in negotiations to free imprisoned bloggers.</p>

<p>If you are interested and able, please visit their site or email them.</p>

  <p>Finally some useful help from the &quot;celebrity engineer&quot; Matt Cutts, one of the few people in the world that has had intimate relations with the Google Pagerank algorithm.  (EDIT: He also happens to use Wordpress, not Blogger. Hmmm.)</p>

<p>This is a description of how to best reference your urls in order to ensure that Google understands them clearly. (the corresponding clarity, is designed -- clearly -- to increase your rank.) </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-advice-url-canonicalization/">blog </a>of Cutts: </p>

<blockquote class="large">Q: What is a canonical url? Do you have to use such a weird word, anyway?
A: Sorry that it' a strange word; that's what we call it around Google. Canonicalization is the process of picking the best url when there are several choices, and it usually refers to home pages. For example, most people would consider these the same urls:

    * www.example.com
    * www.example.com/
    * example.com
    * example.com/
    * www.example.com/index.html
    * example.com/home.asp

  <h2>What a Relief: Google Maps for Mac</h2>
  <p>This is minor news in most contexts: <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth </a>(the software power tool that feels like a toy) has been released for the Mac. </p>

<p>Aside from the obvious usefulness of this release, this signals a money-where-their-mouth-is confirmation thae Google isn&#39;t just reinforcing Microsoft&#39;s monopolistic dominance. </p>

<p>Google has offered a wealth of opportunities for open source, multi-platform development. But their unusual business model (offer almost <em>everything</em> for free) means that they&#39;ve been targeting the largest mass of computer users -- Microsoft-bound users, that is. </p>

<p>As (Open Source Journalist) <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/">Glyn Moody </a>wrote recently:</p>

<blockquote class="large">Google's software is heavily weighted towards Microsoft Windows. Programs like Google Earth and Picasa are only available under Windows, and its latest, most ambitious foray, the Google Pack, is again only for Microsoft's operating system. This means that every time Google comes out with some really cool software, it is reinforcing Microsoft's hold on the desktop. Indeed, we are fast approaching the point where the absence of GNU/Linux versions of Google's programs are a major disincentive to adopt an open source desktop.</blockquote>

<p>Glad to see that little bit of criticism go so out of date so quickly. Now, Google, a Linux release, please.</p>

  <h2>Mapping Bird Flu</h2>
  <p>I have spent an awful lot of (relative) time writing about maps in this space over the last month, but this one really caught my eye. </p>

<p>Declan Butler has recently worked with the journal <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/index.html">Nature </a></em>to publish a map of the H5N1 avian influenza virus outbreaks over the last two years. He used some data from various government sources, an MS Access database, and the ever popular (astoundingly fun) <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> application.</p>

<p>This is why the new breed of online maps are such wonderful tools for creating understanding: With a little technical work (and perhaps a lot of fact-checking), you can create simple yet information-rich presentation of a pandemic that is affecting millions.</p>

<p>Good writeups of the new map can be found on the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060105/full/060105-1.html">Nature website</a> and at <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003959.html">WorldChanging</a>.  (You can find details of the programming side on Declan&#39;s <a href="http://declanbutler.info/blog/?p=16">Blog</a>.)</p>

<p>The trendiness of &quot;mashups&quot; is frustrating to me when I see it only being applied to giving superfluous but super-detailed information about movie times and local gas prices.   </p>

<p>In this anticapitalist, curmudegonly spirit I appreciate journalist Glyn Moody&#39;s alternative description of Google Earth &quot;conceptually simple scaffolding for other data to be brought together and displayed.&quot; As he points out in his <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/">bioinformatics/open source blog</a>, this type of platform has incredible implications for the sharing of scientific resources. Like all open source concepts/applications, this has the greatest impact on science in the developing world, where resources  remain scant. </p>

  <h2>Community Mapping Network (CMN)</h2>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.shim.bc.ca/">Community Mapping Network </a> (CMN)provides an online mapping application that allows folks in British Columbia, Canada, to create and edit information about environmental resources in their areas. </p>

<p>The application is used for sustainable city planning efforts and other types of environmentally-sensitive decision making. </p>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, the CMN also hosts a directory of international projects, which you can contact and volunteer with if you&#39;re so inclined. These are mostly intended to &quot;collect natural resource information about fish and wildlife species and sensitive riparian, fresh water and marine habitats.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s a Canadian grassroots effort, and it&#39;s a wonderful thing to see. I especially like their broader mission to empower communities environmentally: </p>

<blockquote class="large">Mapping typically takes place in rural and urban areas to assist planning sustainable communities and should also be used as a vehicle for empowering community conservation and stewardship of natural resources."</blockquote>

<p>I love this site and their model (although some of their Macromedia ColdFusion mapping applications didn&#39;t work on my computer.)</p>

<p>I believe that this type of project might be feasible for other types of community projects or collaboratives. Perhaps GPS cellphones and some server-side GIS could make a popular urban system investigating, perhaps, an environmental justice problem.</p>

  <p>Not that I have followed any of this advice yet, but here&#39;s a thoughtful article about preparing websites for an international audience from <a href="http://www.molly.com">Molly Holzschlag</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="large">Despite the fact that the Web has been international in scope from its inception, the predominant mass of Web sites are written in English or another left-to-right language. Sites are typically designed visually for Western culture, and rely on an enormous body of practices for usability, information architecture and interaction design that are by and large centric to the Western world.

There are certainly many reasons this is true, but as more and more Web sites realize the benefits of bringing their products and services to diverse, global markets, the more demand there will be on Web designers and developers to understand how to put the World into World Wide Web.</blockquote>

  <h2>Beautiful Maps of Africa</h2>
  <p>Just discovered a beautiful resource of maps (mostly environmental info, especially soil) for most of the countries of Africa.  (Found via <a href="http://blog.uhuru.de/?p=177">Kikuyumoja&#8217;s realm</a>.)</p>

<p>This is an incredibly thorough, high-quality resource, with scanned resolutions that will knock any map-lover&#39;s socks off.  The pages are easy to navigate, with appropriately-sized thumbnails and then really large downloadables. </p>

<p>Suitable for framing. And repurposing with overlaid data. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit from their intro: </p>

<blockquote class="large">"<strong>Data and information are essential building blocks of science. Many types of data, including extant historical data which have newly appreciated scientific importance for the analysis of changes over time, are not being used for research because they are not available in digital formats</strong>" (International Council for Science, 2004).

Maps made in the past remain the backbone for present and future studies. ... Less and less new, fundamental soil data are being produced these days; the older data and information are being pumped around more and more. Therefore it is vital to preserve the older data (in this case maps) as they are building blocks of most current soil information. The user of present-day, derived information should have easy access to the source material, if only to assess the reliability of the derived material.

But, in many countries, soil maps are being lost because of lack of proper attention to storage and retrieval ... This problem is acute in developing and transitional countries where valuable data, currently only available on paper, must be digitized before they are lost forever... The digitization of the African maps will enable the African countries to recover and re-use their soil information.

Translation of soil information from paper maps and reports into digital format is a prerequisite of the next step - the <strong>development of a digital information system on soil and terrain that may be drawn upon for manifold applications</strong>.</blockquote>

  <h2>Mobile Web Design: Tips & Techniques (Technical)</h2>
  <p>Web Designers everywhere are taking a break. </p>

<p>Sometime about 5 years ago people began to realize the frustrating limits of web development because the existing standards were so poorly followed by existing browsers. It was something like what Frost said about &quot;poetry without rhyme is like playing tennis without a net.&quot; </p>

<p>Which is to say, no fun at all. Online communication has progressed steadily since then, and now we have wonderful fruits like &quot;AJAXy goodness&quot; and other Web 2.0 technologies to reap. So take a break from griping about Netscape vs. Internet Explorer. </p>

<p>But Google Maps (etc.) being accomplished, we&#39;re looking for ever greater technologies. The next frontier of web development is the mobile browser -- the web in a cell phone. </p>

<p>The concept of the mobile web has been huge this year, and it is now taken as a fact that most internet users in the next 5 years will be getting online for the first time through their cell phones. </p>

<p>And so, with that in mind, here&#39;s a great series of articles from designer Cameron Moll that looks at the background of the mobile web and explores the specifics of developing +designing reliable, readable sites for really, really small screens. </p>

<blockquote class="large">How do we designers and code slingers cope with the current state? What slings and what doesn'? This article attempts to present technical advice on a superficial level. </blockquote>

  <h2>Evaluating ICT Impact With An Eye on Gender</h2>
  <p>Last week a 2004 article turned up on Eldis: a consideration of how to measure the impact of ICTs in women&#39;s lives. The article begins with a great discussion of what a gender perspective means for people working with technologies of communication. (It cites the United Nations as finding that ICT access is the third most important issue facing women, after violence and poverty.)</p>

<p>The conclusion of the study is essentially that those who implement ICTs must take into consideration the real lives and conditions of women, else they are liable to perpetuate inequaliy. </p>

<blockquote class="large">"Computer technology (like any technology) is shaped by the values, assumptions, goals and prejudices of those involved in its design, engineering and financing.  Its use and influence in society is shaped by the roles, values, assumptions and goals of those who own it and those who can access it.  Technologies introduced into environments characterised by inequality tend to reinforce and even exacerbate it." </blockquote>

<p>I found it especially important that they emphasize the necessity of involving women (indeed all stakeholders in the program equally) in the design and implementation process. </p>

<p>This connects fundamentally with a participatory evaluation approach, the concept that you have to (in the author&#39;s words): 
<ul>
    <li>Involve stakeholders as the evaluators of your program (those who determine the meaning of success).</li>
    <li>Link evaluation findings to action.
</li>
    <li>Encourage evaluation that is truly &quot;participatory (by all stakeholders): involvement of all types of stakeholder in the evaluation process, particularly at the grass roots level, and support for accountability.&quot;     </li>
<li>Be context sensitive to the reality of the user environment. 
</li></ul></p>

  <h2>The Digital Dashboard: Graphing ICT Change</h2>
  <p>Here&#39;s an interesting feature from a nonprofit organization called the <a href="http://public.gov3.net/public_pages/limited/default.htm">gov3 Network</a>, which appears to be a kind of ICT government consultancy. They have a interesting feature on their website that dynamically draws data comparing a country (of your choice) to other countries with regard to their ICT-sector growth. </p>

<p>Put a country and comparison region into this <a href="http://public.gov3.net/public_pages/limited/research/benchmarking/gov3_digital_dashboard.htm">Digital Dashboard</a>, and the result is a data-dense graph that is intended to give governments a sense of how quickly they are moving in the right (or wrong) direction for growing their tech sector. </p>

<p>I think this could be a useful tool, but I&#39;m wary of private organizations seeking (lobbying?) for &quot;more proper&quot; regulation of the ICT sector as being a thin veil for simply giving opportunity to industry, not people. That said, they have a stated interest in promoting &quot;a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society.Also, they&#39;ve recently won an award at WSIS for <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/Homepage/fs/en">DirectGov</a>, a website that brings together a mess of information about UK government services. </p>

  <h2>Beautiful Packaging, Ugly Statistics</h2>
  <p>Recently in my commutes to work I&#39;ve been using these incredible flash-based, interactive representations of development statistics. (Don&#39;t worry, I ride the bus.) These modules, created by a Swedish group called Gapminder, are attractively designed and highly educational.  I have long been a great fan of sharp design in the interest of development. These are as great a communication tool as I have ever seen. </p>

<p><img class="left" src='/wp-content/uploads/Noname.png' alt='Gapminder Screenshot' /></p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder </a>website:</p>

<blockquote class="large">"Gapminder is a non-profit venture for development and provision of free software that visualize human development. ... It all started in 1998 from an idea to enhance the understanding of world health. We developed prototype software showing time series of health statistics as moving graphics and varying life conditions as 360¬? photo panoramas from homes, schools and health facilities. From the prototype emerged the Dollar Street project with Save the Children Fund in Sweden and the World Health Chart project with WHO. Within the later project Gapminder developed the free software Trendalyzer that turns boring time series of development statistics into attractive moving graphics. "</blockquote>

<blockquote class="large">
<img class="left" src='http://www.pictr.org/wp-content/PanosTBolstadradio.jpg' alt='Man with radio' />
This report reviews the evidence on how (or if) ICTs should be used in support of poverty reduction exercises.

There is one characteristic that is common to most of the ICT-related poverty alleviation programs. It finds that the most effective ICTs used are typically basic ones‚ telephone and radio are most common, and when computers or the Internet are involved, they are for restricted, targeted uses.

It finds several common characteristics of successful projects:

    * the focus is on poverty alleviation and not on ICT use
    * ICT components are kept as simple as practical
    * ICT practitioners are involved in the design of the ICT components
    * there is significant community involvement
    * there is a focus on training to ensure success and sustainability
    * there is consideration of a plan for success; how to replicate and scale project if it is successful</blockquote>

  <h2>Developments - The International Development Magazine - Only connect</h2>
  <p>I&#39;ve just been getting into a magazine called &quot;Developments: The International Development Magazine.&quot; It features respectable journalists writing informed pieces about new issues in international development. The most recent issue is a great bit about Open Source Software and the impact of free programs in the developing world. </p>

<p>I appreciate the E.M. Forester reference in the title of this editorial note, &quot;Only Connect,&quot; which is from Howard&#39;s End. The full text is: &quot;Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. &quot; Another favorite Forester truism, from Passage to India, is that &quot;Ideas are fatal to caste.&quot; </p>

<p>But there is some irony I think in sticking Forester in here, considering his great distopian story &quot;The Machine Stops,&quot; (<a href="http://brighton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~prajlich/forster.html">full text</a>) in which human progress has &quot;come to mean the progress of the Machine,&quot; and everyone has thousands of meaningless, connections with friends they have never met. </p>

<p>Sidney Perkowitz has an excellent discussion of Forester&#39;s views of technology and &quot;The Machine Stops;&quot; here&#39;s a bit (via American Prospect):  </p>

<blockquote class="large">Fearing that more technology meant less humanity, he utterly rejected the technical achievements of his time. In 1908, after hearing of the first successful airplane flight over a kilometer-long circuit, he wrote in his journal, ". . . if I live to be old, I shall see the sky as pestilential as the roads. . . . Science . . . is enslaving [man] to machines. . . . Such a soul as mine will be crushed out." But we have come to learn that instead of producing a monolithically "bad" or "good" effect, a rich technology usually generates a balance sheet of benefits and costs‚Äîmany of them unpredictable, because people use technology in unexpected ways. Thomas Mann once said, "A great truth is a truth whose opposite is also a great truth." A significant technology also embraces opposites; if some of its applications constrain human potential, others enhance it.</blockquote>

<p>And so, with some apprectiation of situational humor and contradiction, I think this issue of Developments gets even better. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the bit from the editorial leadin of the current issue: </p>

<blockquote class="large"><img class="left" src='/wp-content/uploads/cover.jpg' alt='Developments magazine' />
In Zambia a street market vendor is paying for his order of Coca-Cola by text message. In Tanzania a candidate in the Presidential elections has been awarded his degree after completing it online through distance learning. In Nairobi, a daughter is sending money to her father in rural Kenya with prepaid pay as you go airtime. And in Namibia schoolchildren are surfing the net, sending emails and writing essays thanks to FLOSS, open source software written by enthusiastic programmers who don't want any payment.

New technology is changing the face of international development in ways that no one predicted. And in this issue of developments we ask how technology can fight poverty ‚Äì from the fisherman using his mobile to check which market wants his catch to the Ethiopians taking to blogging to change global perceptions of their country. The net, of course, has long been touted as a revolutionary tool for international development, but the global explosion in mobile phone use means it has rapidly caught up. And mobile phones are easier to share, requiring much less time to use, are more portable and you don‚Äôt have to read or write to use them.</blockquote>

  <h2>Digital Libraries for Education</h2>
  <p>The Digital Library for Earth Systems Education is a good example of the potential for using the web as a community repository of educational resources. </p>

<p>Unlike some of the other educational websites I&#39;ve seen (which typically distribute prepackaged course materials), the DLESE has a strong emphasis on community input. </p>

<p>Having been around since 2001, it has a pretty extensive selection of resources, most of them related to the natural sciences (from the Mars rover to tsunamis). </p>

<p>I have seen some discussion recently about the value of this type of resource in areas like New Orleans, where entire libraries have been lost. It&#39;s not difficult to extend this logic to the context of Liberia or Pakistan, though we have a little way to go before this type of resource is widely multilingual and accessible to teachers worldwide. </p>

  <h2>ICT4D Africa Scan: An Inventory of ICT Activity in Africa</h2>
  <p>The ICT4D (Informaiton and Communication Technology for Development) Africa Scan is a serious undertaking that seeks to provide a reference of the major ICT development activities  in Africa. </p>

<p>This is a useful place for researchers to begin when attempting to understand the current pace and direction of technology development work on the continent. </p>

<blockquote class="large">
<img class="left" src='/wp-content/uploads/photo_01.jpg' alt='People Using a computer' />The purpose of this pilot is to experiment with a different way of presenting "who is doing what" in the area of ICT for Development (ICT4D) in Africa. It takes as its starting point a representative sample of funding institutions and maps their ICT4D programs and initiatives in Africa against a backdrop of countries, regions and themes. It also makes an attempt to identify the organisations with which these development institutions partner, and in what areas these partnerships occur.

The result is currently not a comprehensive inventory, but an illustration of the potential of using geographic, thematic and partnership information to not only provide an inventory or a snapshot of ICT4D activity in Africa, but to begin to see trends in terms of emerging themes, in terms of countries and regions of specialisation, in terms of partnerships, etc.

  <h2>eRiders Are Taking Off, I Hope</h2>
  <p>The concept of eRiders is deceptively simple: people with lots of tech skills don't need to be on the staff of every NGO or nonprofit, they can "ride" a circut of folks that they help. This idea is being presented at WSIS this week, and I think it is an incredibly powerful idea that will be used increasingly around the world. </p>

<blockquote class="large"><p>TUNIS, Tunisia -- One of the focuses of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) process has been on the cross-cutting nature of technology, and how it can act as an enabler of other development objectives. </p>

<p>Civil society has always had a significant part to play in development objectives and achieving the . Except for a few notable examples though, civil society has not fully embraced technology in its development work. </p>

<p>In a workshop session on eRiders at WSIS, Toni Eliasz from Ungana-Afrika today presented a "replicable and low cost ICT capacity building and support model" uniquely suited to enabling technology within this under-resourced sector.</p>

<p>He presented eRiders as an ICT consultancy solution for small, mission-focused NGOs which can't afford a full-time technology support person.</p> 

<p>eRiders are consultants that work with a group of development organisations concurrently. They are motivated by the development objectives of the organisations they work with, but their focus is on helping these organisations employ technology to achieve their missions.</p> 
<p>
Although eRiders perform a number of technical functions, one of their key functions is demystifying technology and making the concepts accessible.</p>

Initially, an eRider\'s focus will be on smoothening normal operational activities within an organisation. As the relationship develops, the eRider will encourage a more strategic approach to technology, and new program delivery innovations may become available through technology.

  <h2>Windmills for Wi-Fi</h2>
  <p>
Woo Hoo! Wind-powered wireless!:
</p>

<blockquote class="large">
<p>"A University of Texas professor creates tiny windmills to tilt at providing electricity: The prof has developed a system with his group that uses piezoelectric crystals which, when flexed by the small pressures provided by a 10-centimeter windmill running as slow as 17 kilometers per hour, can produce 7.5 milliwatts of electricity. This could be enough to power wireless sensors. After reading an excellent article on flywheels in Wired back in 2000, I envision a nifty future in which remote wireless transceivers could combine a small windmill, solar cells, and flywheels (instead of batteries) for a long-lived and low-maintenance power trio. Wi-Fi, of course, drains much more than 7.5 mW, and other technologies would be even higher. But this is an interesting start. If it's cost effective someday to build tiny windmills, it may also be reasonable to build small, but not absolutely tiny ones that meet the downward spiral of wireless network power requirements in the middle. His paper from last year can be downloaded....

  <h2>The Wireless Internet Opportunity For Developing Countries</h2>
  <p>While poking around on stuff related to the WSIS in Tunis, I found this excellent document about wireless internet in Africa, which was used at the first meeting of the WSIS in 2003. I only wish that there was an updated copy somewhere ...
</p>

<blockquote class="large"><p>"The most intriguing application [of wireless technology] in developing nations is the deployment of low-cost broadband Internet infrastructure and last-mile distribution.</p>
<p>The rationale for such interest is simple in theory: The digital divide cannot be resolved any time soon because of the prohibitive cost of deploying conventional wired infrastructure in developing countries. <b>Wireless Internet, however, has the potential to solve this bottleneck</b>, as the collection of articles and case studies in this volume demonstrates. ...</p>

<p>So, why should this topic become central to the World Summit on Information Society initiative? First, wireless Internet may be a very effective and inexpensive connectivity tool, but <b>it does not carry any magic in itself</b>. It can only be successfully deployed as demand for connectivity and bandwidth emerges in support of relevant applications for the populations served. These may be supporting e-government, e-education, e-health, e-business or e-agriculture applications. But those are not easily implemented in the developing world. They do suggest that wireless Internet can indeed be <b>sustainably</b> and in some cases profitably deployed in support of economic and social development objectives in developing countries.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The greatest aspect of this document is that it represents how often the most successful cases of adoption is grassroots and local -- this type of development does not work well when it is imposed by some NGO or corporation.
</p>

<p>You can read the entire document at <a href="http://www.infodev.org/">infodev</a>, an organization created to "promote better understanding, and effective use, of information and communication technologies (ICT) as tools of poverty reduction and broad-based, sustainable development."</p>

  <h2>Open Source Software in the Developing World</h2>
  <p>This report details how budget-strapped organizations working in the developing world are able to use open source software to accomplish computing task that would otherwise just be too expensive.</p>

<p>From the introduction:</p>

<blockquote class="large">
<p>The emphasis on openness in open source software has fostered the growth of a world-wide community of developers contributing to the evolution and improvement of various software programs for use in networked servers and desktop systems ranging from operating systems and web servers, to e-mail, word processing and spreadsheets. While such a diffused structure for software development may seem chaotic, this approach is being considered as a more democratic alternative to monolithic single vendor efforts. 
</p>

<img src="/images/Picture67.png" />
<p>Interest in OSS is Likely to Grow:
While ICT priorities will vary among countries, as it increases as a component of a country s development strategy, understanding OSS dynamics should also have more importance. With some discussions becoming quite passionate, decision-makers will have questions about the potential that open source software may offer, where and how it should be used, along with its potential risks. </p>

<p>OSS is Different from Proprietary Software:
With OSS, the programming code used to create software solutions is available for inspection, modification, re-use and distribution by others. It is often assumed that open source software is free of charge. While this can be the case, OSS can be purchased for a fee as well. The concept of free, in this context, emphasizes what can be done with the source code rather than its cost. Because of its collaborative nature, the open source model lends itself to allow participants to be both producers and consumers/users of the software. </p>

<p>OSS Arguments Range from the Technical to the Economic:
The OSS topic incorporates the concepts of community, public good, non-commercialism, ecosystems, and issues of intellectual property, copyrights and patents. Underlying much of the discussion is that 'information' in general, and 'software' as a means of delivery is unlike other goods and services. Central to the discussion are the issues of when and if information should be owned versus shared, what is the value of software, and when is it considered a commodity. </p></blockquote>

  <h2>Fear and Loathing in Tunis</h2>
  <p>It seems somehow appropriate that the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) is being held in Tunis. What to do with a government widely criticized for its repressive watchfulness in the public sphere? Let them host a mega-conference designed to make progress toward a more equitable, open vision of the web and the new ICT-driven world.</p><p>I'm not being sarcastic: It sounded like a good idea to me. Tunisia has relatively high internet usage for Africa (just over 10%). What better way to encourage change in a society than to put them on the world stage? I thought they would get their act together. </p>

<p>But this hasn't happened in Tunisia, and, in, fact, quite the opposite has occurred. Two days ago, before the meeting could really even get underway, journalists and human rights advocates were being beaten at the very doors of the conference, just as they had arrived. </p>

<p><blockquote class="large"><p>
At 09.30 am on Monday, November 14, 2005, at the Place d&rsquo;Afrique in Tunis, more than 30 plainclothes policemen impatiently awaited international and Tunisian delegates and members of civil society.</p><p>Omar Mestiri, Director of the online magazine Kalima and a founder member of the National Council for Freedom in Tunisia (Conseil national pour les libert&eacute;s en Tunisie &#8211; CNLT) was seized as soon as he arrived at the site for the meeting of the coordinating committee of the Citizens&rsquo; Summit on the Information Society (CSIS).</p></blockquote><p> The Citizen&#39;s Summit is perhaps the best thing going for an otherwise depressing Tunis conference -- and, depressingly, Tunis has already <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HRW/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.htm">acted to block the independent events from ever happening</a>. </p><p>When it was decided in Geneva a couple years ago that the meeting would be held in Tunis, they could not have been so optimistic (as I was!) as to think that Tunisia would return the favor by behaving beautifully for the conference -- this isn&#39;t the Olympics. </p><p>Amnesty International is has been calling for Tunis to be held accountable: 
</p><blockquote class="large"><p>&quot;... the Tunisian government&rsquo;s record on freedom of expression and access to information is a poor one, and those who speak out in favour of reform and greater protection of human rights are subjected to persecution and harassment by the state authorities. Currently, the Tunisian government maintains strict controls on free speech and use of the Internet, refuses to allow the free operation of domestic human rights groups and holds hundreds of political prisoners, including some who have been jailed for the peaceful expression of their beliefs and are considered by Amnesty International to be prisoners of conscience.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>But this beating of Mestiri at the WSIS is absolutely shameful: The UN needs to be protecting these attendees. I&#39;m worried for all the good folks who are going there, as Ethan Zuckerman says as he blogs his visit there, to visit with friends in spite of sense that it is a repressed, pointless endeavor.</p><p>Real discussion of the internet is not, apparently, on the table at WSIS. But meanwhile the blogosphere continues to spin: Andy Carvin is <a href="http://www.edwebproject.org/wsisblogs/">reposting blogs covering the event</a>.</p><p>Leadership on the internet is important. WSIS is an essential event. Yes, it may provide opportunity for a host country to clean up their act, but these events are ridiculous. Tunisia is no better for being the host this year, and the world is certainly no better. What a waste.

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>The Evolution of the Library: a Tool of Development</h2>
  <p>Soon we'll have far fewer excuses for not distributing the worlds most valuable information resources: libraries. What will it take for us to start reorganizing and exporting our libraries digitally for the sake of global education? 
</p>

<p>The good news is that, on several fronts, there are efforts underway to digitize published content on a massive scale. This will reduce distribution costs to virtually nothing. These efforts were begun recently by Google but are now being undertaken by Yahoo! and, perhaps more notably, Microsoft. The next step, however, is to get over the  of this content, and there remain numerous obstacles to this goal. </p> 

<p>Currently it is clear that the central obstacle is our regressive form of copyright law, which "protects" the ownership of information for deeply flawed reasons.</p><p> The summary effect of these copyright laws to prevent the free distribution of information.</p>  

<p> If the railroad tycoons of an earlier U.S.A. hadn't been around to create the library system from the spoils of their industry, for example, the U.S.A. would have a major hole in its educational system. I think the same principle applies here: the capacity to educate the world exists, and the potential is real. What's holding things back is a flawed profit model that hordes information needlessly.</p>

<p> Get this: The principle of copyright law in the words of the University of Michigan's head librarian, a "balancing act between the limited rights of the author and the rights of the public." Those are strong words, and I think they are well said. On the occasion of being sued for scanning books with Google print, which has just launched a new search feature, this librarian wrote: 


<blockquote class="large">"We continue to be enthusiastic about our partnership with Google, and we are confident that this project complies with copyright law. The overarching purpose of copyright law is to promote <b>progress in society</b>. 

... 

"[The digitizing of books] is a tremendously important public policy discussion. In the future, most research and learning is going to take place in a digital world. <b>Material that does not exist in digital form will effectively disappear</b>. We need to decide whether we are going to allow the development of new technology to be used as a tool to restrict the public's access to knowledge, or if we are going to ensure that people can find these works and that they will be preserved for future generations."</blockquote></p>

If digitizing books is becoming essential to preserving them, then we are getting that much closer to a world where the highest quality information (as opposed to the internet, which is a at best a chaotic database), is reproducible for free: what a wonderful thing. Now we just have to get over out 200-year-old copyright model and recognize a broader, public use for information. The library-building tycoons of the 19th century did it, so why can't we?



<p> This line of thinking fits well into into the general digitization of books, which is becoming a reality, as is indicated by Microsoft's entrance this week into the book-scanning foray pioneered by Google earlier this year: 

<blockquote class="large"><p> After Google <a href="http://www.nitle.org/tech_news.php?id=616"> redefined</a>  the search of printed books, and Yahoo entered the lists, Microsoft is <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/10-26-2005/0004195020&EDATE="> now</a>  planning on launching its own book scanning project.  Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/oct05/10-25MSNBookSearchPR.mspx"> announced</a>  that it will partner with the Open Content Alliance, scanning public domain texts.
</p><p><em> (via <a href="http://www.researchbuzz.org/2005/10/microsoft_jumps_on_the_book_in.shtml"> Research Buzz</a> )
</em></p></blockquote></p>

<p>
On a related note, there are several new technologies that are helping folks do interesting, though apparently not extremely useful things with their books, videos, cds and other real-world media. Perhapos these will play a role in the redistibution of the worlds information gold mines. 
</p>

<p>Library Thing, a new bit of software, for example, allows users to easily catalogue their books like so:</p>

<p><blockquote class="large"><p>&quot;Registration is simple - give it a username and a password. No other personal information is requested. Adding books is just as easy. So many people are using Library Thing (they recently accounced they had 1 million tags) now that a simple search on an author or title will most likely pull the book up, which can be added to your catalog with a single click. You can also input ISBNs if you like. Quickly add tags, a rating and a review if you like. It&rsquo;s fast and easy to add books and metadata.&quot;
 (Found on:<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a>.)
</p></blockquote><p>There are some other sites that do similar things, and there are some related gadget features, like using your Apple iSight camera to scan barcodes and get your entire library in the time it would take to scan a few loads of groceries. As a personal process, this sounds a little gimmicky to me, and I doubt that there will really be a lasting impact to this line of thinking as a &quot;product.&quot; Perhaps that&#39;s incorrect -- I haven&#39;t tried it and I&#39;m not much of a tagger in general. 
</p><p>But I do really like the idea of tagging books and sharing tag libraries -- creating, essentially, evolutionary indexes to books that could help people make more sense of the things that they are reading. If people are sharing their tags about their books, then we could have massive, elaborate networks of metadata about our printed works in precisely the same way that so many people are now doing en masse with online content. (A la technorati and del.icio.us et al.)
</p><p>What I&#39;m imagining is a kind of deli.cio.us for libraries, in which patrons using the &quot;card catalogue&quot; are encouraged to add their own notes about books. This is not an unrealistic web app -- you&#39;d just build something into the existing library website. You link a few dozen websites (let the librarians sandardize it, they&#39;ll have a blast, and librarians will all be web developers in 15 years) and in short order you&#39;ve got rich, evolving, user-contributed data about your stacks. So much the better for a world awash in data: could log in search my library, find a relevant book, then get rich suggestions about related books from the tags.

  <p>Here&#39;s another update on the laptop debate/idea from Ethan Zuckerman, the ICT-blogger-fellow at Harvard. He usefully recounts the point of the new prototypical $100 laptop as being a radical step toward computer-aided learning in developing countries. I appreciate his skepticism about the project, especially his explicit reference to the late, not-so-great simputer idea, which bombed because of economics. </p>

<p>You know, that pesky money thing. Always a problem when dealing with poverty.</p></p>

<p>here&#39;s a bit: 
<blockquote class="money">
&quot;After peppering Negroponte with two hours of questions, I&rsquo;m fairly convinced that this laptop won&rsquo;t suffer the problems the Simputer did - I believe it will get produced and distributed and that the software will enable e-books, web browsing, word processing and programming. As much as I enjoy the geekery of challenging Negroponte and others on the fine points of hardware and software design for the developing world, I&rsquo;m convinced that some extremely smart people are working very hard on the hardware and software side of things. While I might question some of the decisions made, I don&rsquo;t know that my second-guessing is helpful at this point.</p>

  <h2>Location-aware en masse</h2>
  <p>How do you make a regular cellphone location-aware? Apparently, you monitor the records indicating which tower the phone is on. Movement from one tower to the next can give highly accurate readouts on the movement of individuals and crowds.</p>

<p>I wouldn't think that this would give you manageable data that was accurate enough to do anything with, but it turns out that, yet again, profit motives will find a way. Companies are working with cellphone carriers to track traffic patterns to prevent traffic jams. You will sign up for a fee and get readouts of the general direction of people.</p>

<p> This seems more significant, however, because of the general applicability of this method. Apparently it is even possible to tell with some accuracy wether the cellphone traveling -- which doesn't even have to be turned on (!) -- is in the pocket of a person traveling by bike, by foot, or by car. This would allow, perhaps, for sophisticated monitoring of disaster relief efforts, for example.</p> 

<p>Fascinating, but also, for some, Orwellian. Privacy advocates are worried about this emergence of broader monitoring applications, particularly in the instance of a developing protests. Recent spontaneous protests in Latin America and China come to mind. Police would theoretically be able to tell where protesters were convening just by looking at changes in the traffic patterns of cell phones.</p><p> It's hard not to imagine some hollow volcano where we're all being tracked like so many schools of fish, but there must be some useful applications here as well. We'll see how the market develops.</p>

  <h2>Hooray for Progressive Podcasting</h2>
  <p>Podcasting is not complicated. It's just audio. The problem lies in finding something worth listening to. 
</p>

<p>I subscribe to about a dozen podcasts, most of them technology-related, though some are about education or the media. (Technology-anything is always easy to find on the internet, naturally, because that's where the experts live.) Soon we'll have high-quality podcasts about a much broader range of subjects, and I expect that many of them will be coming from much smaller, more independent producers. Keep an eye on the podcast directories such as the one hosted at <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/">www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts</a>. For now, however, I must admit that -- contrary to that maverick, grassroots image that hovers over podcasting -- I listen to an awful lot of stuff from larger outlets like NPR and PBS. (I'm especially fond of <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/">On The Media</a> from NPR. Bob Garfield just cracks me up.)
</p>

<p>By the same token however, podcasts can help me tune into things on NPR that are well-produced, but have very limited distribution. I'm thinking of Christopher Lydon's <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/">Open Source</a>, which is an excellent liberal call-in show produced by WGBH. Lydon is just sharp, and he certainly has a great deal of experience running a radio program. I'm listening now, offline, as I write. Their format embraces the use of the internet by actively soliciting comments and ideas through the web, and they do it worldwide, often including perspectives from the people that they are talking about. A nice package that I'd other wise miss out on if I weren't a subscriber.   
</p>

<p>Other podcasts, like those of the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/series/bloggercon2004.html">Bloggercon</a> and <a href="http://www.poptech.org/">Pop!tech</a> conference series, attempt -- in a wonderfully useful way -- to reproduce and memorialize some of the ideas that get generated at these geek festivals. This has been an important way for me to have personally participated in conferences that I otherwise could not have afforded to attend (Pop!Tech was in Camden, Maine ... not an easy place to get to). Too bad the logistics of recording conferences are often fraught with recording problems. Audio is hard to do right. (Video, by the way, is a lot harder still, which makes me think that acceptably decent, small-scale videocasting is quite a ways off. Things change fast these days, though.)
</p>

<p>Still other podcasts are the work of real individuals, working in idiosyncratic ways to create something that's often highly personal. Often these remind me of the mid-1990s' heyday of personal webpages ... which means they're important but sometimes ugly. Some are just bad and ulgy. This is what I hope changes as things mature, as we head toward a sweet spot of podcasting content produced by small teams of people who really care and understand what they're talking about. Further still, I hope that we'll be seeing more and more podcasts that address issues at the intersection of society and technology in a progressive, thoughtful way. 
</p>

<p>That's why I was so excited to find this in my RSS aggregator today, from <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com">Ethan Zuckerman</a>:

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>Computers Twice Wasted</h2>
  <p>A recent article in the New York Times discusses a report that computers are being &quot;improperly recycled&quot; (read: dumped) on developing countries as a way to avoid the expense of refurbishing them before redistribution.</p>

<blockquote class="large"><p>"The report, titled "The Digital Dump: Exporting Reuse and Abuse to Africa," says that the unusable equipment is being donated or sold to developing nations by recycling businesses in the United States as a way to dodge the expense of having to recycle it properly. While the report, written by the Basel Action Network, based in Seattle, focuses on Nigeria, in western Africa, it says the situation is similar throughout much of the developing world.

"Too often, justifications of 'building bridges over the digital divide' are used as excuses to obscure and ignore the fact that these bridges double as toxic waste pipelines," says the report. As a result, Nigeria and other developing nations are carrying a disproportionate burden of the world's toxic waste from technology products, according to Jim Puckett, coordinator of the group.

According to the National Safety Council, more than 63 million computers in the United States will become obsolete in 2005. An average computer monitor can contain as much as eight pounds of lead, along with plastics laden with flame retardants and cadmium, all of which can be harmful to the environment and to humans."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an obvious insult to those who end up with the broken computers -- which are presumably also an environmental hazard because of the heavy metals in a monitors and chassis. But this issue has a more important point in the discussions of the &quot;$100 Laptop&quot; prototype being developed at MIT, one major criticism has been that efforts would be better directed at recycling the mid-grade computer trash -- that species of neglected Pentium 3 common in American Suburbia -- for use in developing countries. This appears to be a promising avenue for development of ICT capacity: There is so much usable computer &quot;trash.&quot;  </p>

<p>I think this is the best alternative to the concept of manufacturing $100 laptops, which seems untenable on a large scale. </p>

<p>But the problem implicit in the NYT article is that computer recycling is also harder than it sounds. The logistics required for a workable refurbishing operation are, I fear, insurmountable. Refurbishing is not cheap even for major companies like Dell, which have pre-existing warehouses to do their refurbishing, an existing website with which to sell their repaired wares, and a massive, efficient distribution system. </p>

<p>Any nonprofit that hoped to get computers to poor countries would have to recreate all of these systems, build an intake system (an address I could ship that Pentium 3 to, if I was inclined), and they would additionally have to deal with repairing the <em>hundreds</em> of brands of equipment that they might receive. This is a recipe for an unreliable computer at best, and this doesn&#39;t even begin to address the overhead required for marketing and skilled directors. </p>

<p>Who could do this type of operation? No one I can think of, though I&#39;m willing to keep looking. Until then I think our best bet for cheap global computing is the idealistic Negroponte effort at MIT. </p>

  <h2>Participatory Design</h2>
  <p>I am currently researching a field of design known as &quot;Participatory Design&quot; that has a fascinating history (dealing with Scandinavian labor unions) and a very promising future. In short,  PD is about incorporating the user in the design process from day one. The resulting ideas and workflows are, in my mind, incredibly powerful tools for working on any project. My focus is web development. </p>

<p>Most of my interest in this concept comes from my day job at a nonprofit evaluation firm -- we do &quot;collaborative evaluation&quot; to help programs develop. The concepts are largely the same, and I&#39;m just trying to apply them to web design and the development of usable, useful online tools.</p>

<p>This process is intimately involved with many of the same user-centered concerns that preoccupy other ICT-development folks, such as the advocates of free and open-source software. </p>

<p>The center of the world for PD is the organization <a href="

  <h2>ICT in Education</h2>
  <p>The Scottish government has an excellent collection of resources regarding the use of Information Communication Technology in classrooms. They have multi-part articles grouped by subject (Biology, Drama, Physics), and examples of how, for example, you can show students living cells using microscope and digital camera, or how to use the internet to teach French. Most of it is not Scotland-specific, though they do feature Scottish schools. </p>

<p>My major criticism of the site is that it doesn&#39;t explore low-cost options (such as using open source software). Correspondingly, this site won&#39;t be as useful in less-developed countries.

  <p>As a follow up to the previous post (see just below this one) please be &#39;ware that Global Voices is hosting an online (IRC) discussion of the handbook on Tuesday at 15:00 GMT (that&#39;s 11:00 AM, New York time). </p>

<p>New to IRC chatting? It&#39;s simple. Here&#39;s instructions from the ground up:</p>

<blockquote class="large">  <img alt="RSF-blogger-handbook" src="/images/RSF-blogger-handbook.png" width="150" height="150" />
 <p>1. Download &#038; install an IRC client for your computer. This is the program that will let you access IRC, just like a web browser is the program that lets you access web pages.  Here are links to IRC clients <a href="http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/platforms-windows.html"target="_blank">for Windows users</a> and for <a href="http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/platforms-macos.html"target="_blank">Mac users</a>.<br />
<em>(I use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/rt-messaging/chatzilla/"target="_blank">Chatzilla</a>, which works easily as a plugin with Mozilla Firefox browsers. <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/"target="_blank">Download it here</a>.)</em></p>

    <p>2. Connect to irc.freenode.net. How exactly you do this will depend on which client you install, but you should be able to find support pages online for any good client program.<br />
<em>(In Chatzilla, all you do is type irc://irc.freenode.net into your Firefox browswer window - but this only works </em><em>after </em>you&#8217;ve downloaded the Chatzilla plugin.)</p>
    <p>3. Once you are connected to irc.freenode.net, create a username for yourself. This will identify you to the other people in the IRC channels you join.</p>
    <p>4. Join the channel &#8220;globalvoices&#8221; - again, how you do this will depent on which client you&#8217;re using.<br />

<em>(In chatzilla, all you need to do is type irc://irc.freenode.net/#globalvoices into your Firefox browser window.)</em></p>
    <p>5. Once you&#8217;ve joined the channel, you&#8217;ll be able to see everything anyone else in that channel says, and you can say things to the rest of the channel. </p>

  <h2>The "Dissident" Blogger Handbook</h2>
  <p>Reporters Without Borders has today released a wonderful handbook of international blogging. The 84-page guide includes sections that discuss the basics of blogs and blogging terminology, and it moves quickly into a serious how-to guide for blogging anonymously and blogging successfully. This is a first for the international blogging community, and I am certain that it will receive an extremely warm welcome.<img alt="blogguide.jpg" src="/images/blogguide.jpg" width="200" height="298" /></p>

<p>The guide begins with general discussion of the role of blogs and basic blogging terminology. This is hardly revolutionary coverage, but the writing is solid, with sections from very reputable sources in the international online media scene.</p>

<p>There is also a good section on choosing the right blogging platform, getting things setup to make the search engines happy, and a  lot of serious advice on &quot;making your blog shine.&quot;</p>

<p>There are a few problems in the text, notably the failure to mention several key blogging platforms available for international use. (They mention MSN but not Typepad??) Also, I think there is not adequate description of the differences between a hosted blog service (Like Blogger) and a blogging platform that you have to install on your server (Like Movable Type.)  </p>

<p>But by far the most inspiring part of the handbook (an it is as a whole quite inspiring) is it&#39;s selection of personal accounts from &quot;famous&quot; international bloggers, including selections from a female blogger in China, a writer in Iran, a wonderfully disaffected journalist in the U.S., and a Bahranian blogger who prides himself on &quot;breaking the government&#39;s news monopoly.&quot;</p>

<p>Keeping with the audience-first nature of blogs, everything is eminently readable, with spunky illustration by Nuit de Chine.  </p>

<blockquote>
  This is not a handbook for making money with your blog; it's a serious look at the tools that are available for people who are otherwise not encouraged to communicate. It is for newsmakers without news outlets and people making news who don't make headlines.
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a refreshing break from the wealth of blogging how-tos in the developed world. Those documents may be useful, but they don&#39;t have the kind of detail that you find here for really getting a blog started in China, Nepal, Iran, etc. In this way, the &quot;How to Blog Anonymously&quot; chapter by Ethan Zuckerman must be considered the most important single part of the document. As an online community, there is nothing stopping us from perfecting and distributing tools for subverting government chokeholds on IP addresses. </p>

<p>I am very excited by the guerrilla-free-speech innovation documented here.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://rconversation.com">Rebbecca MacKinnon</a> has written, &quot;Bloggers are often the only real journalists in countries where the mainstream media is censored or under pressure. Only they provide independent news, at the risk of displeasing the government and sometimes courting arrest.&quot;</p>

<p>This handbook is groundbreaking both symbolically and technically, and I think it safe to say that it will evolve to address it&#39;s very few shortcomings. Hopefully it will be re-released regularly, with updates of all the wonderful things that are going on in the blogosphere, new home of the free international press.</p>

  <h2>Raising International Awareness Through Innovative Cartography</h2>
  <p>Being a great way to communicate quickly, maps can also be incredibly dense with information.  When they are put to a wholesome use, maps, like apple pie and puppies, deserve to have a special place in every home.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the incredible work coming out of the Dutch group <a href="http://www.mappingworlds.nl/">Mapping Worlds</a>. They&#39;ve beautifully mapped global poverty, international migration, and civil conflict. They even have a special section of maps for Millennium Development Goals!  </p>

<p>These Nederlanders have their act together. </p>

<p><img alt="oda_june2005.jpg" src="/images/oda_june2005.jpg" width="300" height="189" /></p>

<p>This is their fabulous map of the failed funding effort being undertaken by the developed world for poverty relief. (You can find a larger one on <a href="http://www.mappingworlds.nl/">their site</a>. You know you want to.) It&#39;s shameful, really. </p>

<p>If you enjoy this and have a second or two, be sure to toy with their animated, more robust version at the Center For Global Development, where they have <a href="http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/cdi/_maps/">mapped an index of international commitment</a> to the Development Goals. No really, check that last link, it&#39;s fantastic. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what they say about this project: <blockquote class="large"> The Commitment to Development Index reminds the world that reducing poverty in developing countries is about far more than giving money. Trade, investment, migration, security, environment, and technology policies matter, too. Now in its third year, the CDI ranks 21 of the richest nations on their performance in each policy area, giving you the big picture. View the rankings in charts, learn what the Index rewards and penalizes, compare country report cards, and post comments or suggestions.</blockquote> </p>

<p>It&#39;s an amazing bit of scripting, for sure.</p>

  <h2>Geeks Responding to Katrina: Relief 2.0</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/">Ethan Zuckerman</a> is one of the best bloggers in the world; he must get paid by Harvard to do it, or something. (He does.)</p>

<p>His musing last week on the ICT/geek community&#39;s response to the Katrina relief effort is a fascinating look at how we can potentially respond with the full weight of technology&#39;s resources. </p>

<p>Most notably, Ethan has been recently instrumental in organizing and developing the Katrina Peoplefinder database (in record time,  no less), which exceeded 100,000 entries in the first week of September. I think that this is, for once, an example of how activism in a purely digital sense can in fact be utterly essential, not a trival, isolated indulgence. </p>

<blockquote>Please Note:  This database (at http://www.katrinalist.com)  still has a growing amount of  data; you can still volunteer to enter data remotely (from anywhere in the world, in your pajamas, at  <a href="http://katrinahelp.info/wiki/index.php/Katrina_PeopleFinder_Project">The Katrina Peoplefinder Wiki</a>.     </blockquote>

<p>What is amazing is that this activism has been the work of a <em>very</em> loosely organized group of more than 2,000 people all over the world. The work done by organizers was largely administrative - they assigned various &quot;chunks&quot; of data from fragmented bulletin boards to volunteers who put standardized information into a central database. This I think, was impressively smart, and it needs to be replicated in many other contexts, present and future.</p>

<p>And I believe that the folks involved in the development of the project are acutely aware of this need, and they are taking admirable leadership roles. Online code guru Dave Weiner wrote, for example, about the need of a standardized, open, XML format for transmitting data about missing people.  A day later, there it was, the <a href="http://zesty.ca/pfif/pfif-draft.html">People Finder Interchange Format</a>. </p>

<p>These developments have rediscovered the power of existing technologies. Innovative uses of our everyday-geek tools - including VOIP phones, podcasts, wikis, weblogs, SMS text messages and databases - can affect change in the world. Really, they can. But in the highly developed world we are accustomed to treating them as though they were simply luxuries, toys.

  <h2>What if the Flood Was in Washington?</h2>
  <p>Andy Carvin, director of the Digital Divide Network, recently posted a fascinating, heartbreaking perspective just how much damage has been done. He found the images at a strange condo site, <a href="http://katrina05.blogspot.com/">condobuzz.com</a>. The images are overlays of the flooding with other metropolitan areas. (Note this is <em>just the flooding</em>. The hurricane damages, if in the midwest, would reach from Detroit to Chicago.) Andy&#39;s excellent, popular, collaborative Katrina blog is here:

  <h2>Google Maps: Is My House Underwater?</h2>
  <p>Kathyn Cramer, based in New York, is doing great work with Google maps. The following information is quoted from <a href="http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/2005/09/how_to_find_out.html">her blog</a>. </p>

<p>Step 1: Go to Google Maps and enter the address. Click on the button that says &quot;Hybrid&quot; on the upper right. You will get an image with a speech ballon pointing to a thumbtack showing the location of the address on the satellite photo.
[IMPORTANT UPDATE: Bless their hearts, Google Maps has added a &quot;KATRINA&quot; button to New Orleans areas searches, so they have automated some of the process I describe here! Yee haw!]</p>

<p>Step 2: Click up and down the vertical ladder-like bar to see the image at various scales until you feel you can find the place on a satellite image.</p>

<p>Step 3: Compare your image to this superimposition of the FEMA flood map on a New Orleans satellite photo, created by the Google Earth Current Events Community. Here is a small version. Click on it for a much bigger picture.</p>

<p><img alt="nola_fema_floodmap" src="/images/nola_fema_floodmap.jpg" width="400" height="334" /></p>

<p>If the address you are checking is fairly centrally located, you can also check your address image against the DigitalGlobe satellite picture of the flooding. </p>

  <h2>GIS and Humanitarian Crisis</h2>
  <p><em>With a nod to International Blogging for Disaster Relief Day (Friday, Sept. 2).  ... Crossposted on the DDN list.</em></p>

<p>I am beginning research into ways in which mapping technologies like GIS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gis">wikipedia: GIS</a>) are being used (and can potentially be used) to help avert or cope with humanitarian disasters.</p>

<p>The tragedy of New Orleans has given me some insight into the potential and limitations for this use of geospatial technologies. <img alt="NO-below-Sea-level" src="/images/NO-below-Sea-level.jpg" width="426" height="284" />
Thanks to Andy Carvin for applying his blogging/networking skills to this problem and prompting this line of thinking (<a href="http://katrina05.blogspot.com/">The Katrina Aftermath Blog</a>) . Recent discussion on the <a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/community/digitaldivide">Digital Divide List</a> of geocoded pictures has also been stimulating.</p>

<p>GIS is a sophisticated, robust technology that is being used to map and analyze data in numerous fields, especially environmental studies and public health. One of the most compelling features of GIS research is that it takes advantage of the contemporary wealth of data that is collected by all kinds of environmental monitors. (eg: weather is monitored constantly, and thus existing weather datasets can be mapped geospatially to discover, for example, patterns in flooding or to predict the best time to plant crops.)</p>

<p>New Orleans has for some time been the subject of extensive GIS research because of its precarious position below sea level. The availability of this technology has, I feel certain, prevented or alleviated numerous problems created by the hurricane (perhaps, for example, by helping prepare the safest evacuation routes years ago). I am interested in discovering similar, existing applications for GIS in poorer parts of the world. I would also like to find discussion/research of <em>potential</em> uses, especially, again, in the context of poverty.</p>

<p><img alt="niger-small" src="/images/niger-small.gif" width="200" height="150" href="http://www.reliefweb.int">Cusory searches of the internet  find that there certainly exists a great deal of straightforward mapping going on in terms of humanitarian crises, most notably (according to my notes) the indexes on <a href="http://www.Reliefweb.int">Reliefweb.int</a>. These are extremely useful documents for creating awareness, but they are also rich, multilayerd doccuments for use by the aidworkers and activists that cope with these problems daily. A pdf file of the crisis in Niger, for example, can be a great way to understand the scope of the problem, but it also can direct the triage more effectively. </p>

<p>The center for New Orleans GIS research is at Louisiana State University; they have an excellent <a href="http://www.publichealth.hurricane.lsu.edu">website</a> that distributes their GIS data to the folks in the government that need the information. I doubt that there is any much more sophisticated model of GIS research. What fascinates me is that, although I am new to GIS, it appears that there is a strong &quot;open source sensibility&quot; about most GIS-- the information is provided free (though sometimes to a limited set of users) and is intended for extended, unmonitored use. How can this be expanded and reproduced in a way that promotes human development?</p>

  <h2>Godcasting</h2>
  <p>Ever since the first Vatican broadcast of a sermon on the radio in 1931, there has been little doubt about the power of broadcast media as a part of religious practice. </p>

<p>Contemporary &quot;church-theatres&quot; (typically the kind with the lights and music shows) are taking the role of media much more seriously, and it appears that they&#39;re adapting to some of the most advanced uses of ICT in the world. In an article in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/technology/">today&#39;s New York Times</a>, it&#39;s noted that individual podcasts from sites like <a href="http://www.theatrechurch.com">theatrechurch.com</a> and <a href="http://www.godcast.com">godcast.com</a> are attracting thousands of subscribers worldwide. That&#39;s a number that&#39;s relatively unheard of at this point in the podcasting evolution.</p>

<p>What is happening is that these communities, already acclimated to the idea of technology-aided practices, are becoming heavily invested in using everything at their disposal to achieve their mission. </p>

<p>But I think the point in all this is more than just an impressive development in the religious sector. The willingness of religious groups to adapt to podcasting and other ICT-based forms of community practice means that this is viable -- that this really works. Podcasting and blogging&#39;s implications have thus far been clear to a few geeks and technologists, but there is, at least among certain populations, a sense in which these religious communities are making it a reality.  </p>

<p>But if youre thinking of Pat Robertson televangelism, consider the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. </p>

<p>The marches, speeches, meetings of the Civil Rights activism of the 1950s and 1960s -- that was what I would call a serious community. And much of it was deeply spiritual, coming from a critical Black religious movement. </p>

<p>There is much work to be done in revitalizing the religious fuel for the social justice fire, and, judging from the excitment generated by the current developments in worship, there may be a wealth of underdeveloped resources for doing so in the near future.  ###</p>

  <h2>Cellphones in Africa</h2>
  <p>Today&#39;s New York Times carries a front-page article about the growth of the cell phone industry in Africa. </p>

<p>The article is as well-written a summary of the communications crisis in Africa as I have ever read -- though it is an undeniably, perhaps inexplicably, upbeat assessment of the curent growth trend in cell phone use. </p>

<p>The article begins by describing the difficulties faced by a rural farmer in Johnanesburg: </p>

<p><blockquote class="large">On this dry mountaintop, 36-year-old Bekowe Skhakhane does even the simplest tasks the hard way.</p>

<p>Fetching water from the river takes four hours a day. To cook, she gathers sticks and musters a fire. Light comes from candles.</p>

<p>But when Ms. Skhakhane wants to talk to her husband, who works in a steel factory 250 miles away in Johannesburg, she does what many in more developed regions do: she takes out her mobile phone.</blockquote></p>

<p><img alt="africa" src="/images/africa.gif" width="184" height="410" align="left"/> Author Shanon LaFranierie did a great job of putting this together, I think, but again the upbeat assessment tends to make the issue more of a spectacle than an outrage. Which it is. Take, for example, the fact that the woman described in the lead actually has the money for only five minutes of calls per month -- a pretty slim communication system indeed. </p>

<p>There is also the fact that while Africa now has the highest percentage of cell phone users relative to land lines, that doesn&#39;t mean much when only one in 30 people has a land line. And the fact that less than 60% of Africa can get any cellphone signal at all is rather sobering. </p>

<p>And yet, there is an undeniable fact of real growth -- economic, social, educational -- that is occuring because of the powerful effect that even a slight improvement in communication can bring. At least when the context is dire poverty, the impact of just a few cellphones can be dramatically disproportinate. </p>

<p>Andy Carvin, a guru of the <a href="http://www.digitaldividenetwork.org/">Digital Divide Network</a> also has some interesting thoughts about this article on <a href="http://www.edwebproject.org/andy/blog/">his blog</a>. </p>

<p>Andy writes that: <blockquote class="large">No doubt, mobile phones will be near the top of the list [of development technologies] -- but that list also includes $100 laptops, wind-up electricity generators, low-cost community radio transmitters, and the timeless ham radio. So let&#39;s not make policy decisions under the assumption that mobile phones are the only tool necessary for bridging the digital divide.</blockquote></p>

  <h2>This Island Blog. (Or, What the Hell is a Blog?)</h2>
  <p>Your dear author recently posted about the ambivalence and misunderstanding that abounds with regard to the concept of RSS. Based on this weeks hilarious (in a laughing-at-you, not-with-you way) <a href="http://www.catalystgroupdesign.com/cofactors/?p=111">usability survey</a> of blogging from Catalyst Group Design, blogging (yes, the entire concept) is about a mainstream as the Kabbalah. </p>

<p>The people they interviewed (about 25 of them) were smart folks in a wealthy, highly industrialized country. They used the internet all the time. But when they came to a normal blog, they were stumped. They asked: What kind of a website is this? What are these categories? Are they organized chronologically?</p>

<p>These are not stupid questions -- they just sound stupid to folks who work with blog publishing software. </p>

<p>The point is this, geeks: people don&#39;t understand what blogs are. They don&#39;t know how to use them effectively and, often, they don&#39;t know how to read them. They certainly don&#39;t know how to subscribe to them via RSS. </p>

<p>If you are a blogger, this may be a difficult concept for you to accept. It was for me. </p>

<p>But ask around. Ask your friends who aren&#39;t geeks. Ask the people at work. I&#39;ll bet you a dollar they don&#39;t know what a blog is. I&#39;ll bet five they don&#39;t read them, and I&#39;ll bet you ten they would be intimidated as hell by the idea of creating their own. (And if I lose that, I&#39;ll bet $50 that, once they start it, they won&#39;t keep up with it.)</p>

<p>For now, we (bloggers) need to recognize that our readership is other bloggers. Don&#39;t get depressed:  that&#39;s a pretty decent concept, mate. We can have our little blogger community and create positive change among ourselves. But clearly, we&#39;ll have to move on to reach other users ... like real people. </p>

<p>So this technical-sounding &quot;usability study&quot; of blogs means a great deal for people trying to create change with online publishing. Here are a few tips that I have tried to follow here: </p>

<p>For one: If you are a blogger, design down your site. I think that simplicity has an inherent currency in all forms of learning -- and all publications are deigned to teach. Consider that your blog, as a text-based medium, would do better to take influences from the world of books (remember those?) than cable TV. </p>

<p>For two: Write for real people, not just geeks. Surely, there is a place for geeky forums, but if your online work is meant to be relevant for people with real lives (present readership excluded), try to avoid terms like trackback and ping, which have a clinically-proven tendency to cause impotence and sleep apnea.</p>

  <p>Here&#39;s a link to a nice comparison of Google Scholar and Scrius. It points out that Google Scholar has become neglected and is no longer updated regularly. This is a super-unfortunate development; Google is the web&#39;s best hope for easy, inexpensive archiving of scholarly research.

  <p>Evaluation is an important, albeit rarefied, science of promoting nonprofit organizations. Do you need to measure the effectiveness of a specific program -- or your entire organization? Well, there&#39;s an entire discipline devoted to helping you do just that. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as with most rarefied, important sciences, the &quot;discipline&quot; part tends to mean something more like &quot;punishment,&quot; rather than &quot;a codified mode of study.&quot; 
At any rate, doing a real, formal evaluation of a program is still better than wasting your time doing something that&#39;s useless, fruitless, a waste of energy or just a sham. So here&#39;s a buch of resources from the internet to help you get going for free. Thanks for this post go to Joyce B. Morris and David Colton, Ph.D., from the EvalTALK Listserv.

  <p>This post from Tech Soup is a good, brief introduction to the use of databases in your organization.</p>

<p>The author of this article (a nice techie from ONE/Northwest) finds that you should really call in the professional to get things set up -- I would agree, but don&#39;t let that keep you from learning how to use it.</p>

<p>A database is an investment of time that can really pay off, especially if you have been managing your donor lists, inventory, etc. by hand. But that means you need to know how to use it. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit from the overview: <blockquote class="large">While it&#39;s no simple task, developing a basic Web site made up of pages of text and images is usually a job that can be taken on by the staff of a nonprofit organization, hopefully with a little help from a professional designer who can aid in the development of the site&#39;s look and feel. Implementing advanced features on your site, however, will most likely require a level of expertise that doesn&#39;t make sense for your organization to internalize.

  <h2>Exporting Technology, Exporting Ideas</h2>
  <p>Summary: There is a new, exciting model for programs exporting technology to the developing world. But the real issue is about education, not just setting up a rural network. </p>

<p><strong>
Here&#39;s the scene:</strong> A decade after the technology-sector collapse in the highly industrialized world, a humbled tech industry has begun to take interest in exporting basic technologies to extremely poor countries. </p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s an example:</strong> <a href="http://www.geekcorps.org">Geekcorps</a>, founded by techie <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/">Ethan Zuckerman</a> with his cash-out-quick money from now-defunct Tripod.com (remember them?), is sending folks to Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America to live out a kind of Peace Corps for nerds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ... exactly like that, actually, so much so that the Peace Corp <a href="http://www.timesleader.com/mld/timesleader/news/world/12155002.htm">reportedly </a>has plans to create a nerd project sounding very similar to Geekcorps. Likewise, Carnegie Mellon University is starting a <a href="http://www.techbridgeworld.org/tpc/index.html">Technology Peace Corps</a>, and so is the UN, which has a three-year-old <a href="http://www.unicttaskforce.org/">ICT (Information Communication Technology) Task Force</a>. </p>

<p>Contemporary communications technology is central to the process of international development because it is effective -- and damn efficient. Communication systems can organize political movements, prevent humanitarian disasters, strengthen communities, streamline markets and enrich education. In fact, they will do these things. </p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s the point</strong>: These new groups are doing good work. Technology can work for people. It can work <em>wonders</em> for really poor people. Communications technology, in particular, has the potential to connect and empower places that you have never heard of, perhaps in poor parts of your district, perhaps in Africa or Asia. Just like it connected you. </p>

<p>But perhaps that&#39;s a problem. Do we want the Ugandan internet to look just like the US internet? Are we capabale of taking a critical approach to the way that we are teaching people to use the internet? Will the internet of 2030 connect communities or consumers? Will it empower or merely reinforce existing power? </p>

<p>Information technology is a virtually limitless resource.  A single telephone (or perhaps a <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/19/30OPreality_1.html">bicycle-operated VOIP system</a>, if you prefer) is a surprisingly powerful vehicle for community development. Installing a single, inexpensive server can support the communication needs of an entire village, just as digging a well can support a village. </p>

<p>But ICT (Information Communication Technology) is not just a commodity, it is also a system. It requires a market, consumers and investors. Which means, I think, that there is a lot more than just altruistic service-giving, training and infrastructure development going on here. </p>

<p>The effort to grow ICT in the developing world is not just a &quot;new model of volunteerism,&quot; as the Peace Corps describes it. Because the power of technology is social. Tech training is an intervention in society akin to grassroots organizing. In this way, teaching technology is a political movement, a movement primarily toward open expression of ideas, in whatever form they may come.</p>

<p>Or it can be, at least. </p>

<p>We (the ICT development community) recognize that we have to train people, not just build phone booths. This has long been seen as the difficult side of exporting technology, but I think it&#39;s important that we value the process of teaching that is at the core of this process. </p>

<p>And teaching has its attendant concerns. Teaching can be progressive, or teaching can recreate the ways of thinking that have led to our current crisis of poverty. Those who are involved in the transfer of technical knowledge for the sake of human development need to think about their method of creating this change, their pedagogy. </p>

<p>Education, not technology per se, is the only sustainable path out of inequality, and we would do well to be appreciative of the fact that we are teachers.</p>

  <h2>Technology for the Poor</h2>
  <p>A technology conference yesterday in England was host to a speaker Iqbal Quadir, who has sold about 100,000 cell phones to poor folks in Bangladesh. These are people who otherwise would have no digital communications, and Quadir feels that their new phones are empowering them more than the development strategies of the last 60 years.</p>

<p>The approach is eloquently summed up on <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com">Ethan Zuckerman&#39;s blog</a> as a bottom-up approach to economic development. Here&#39;s a bit from his <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=85">recent post</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="large">
Iqbal points to a top-down approach favored by the World Bank and others and notes that it puts power into the hands of authority, not into the hands of people. The US didn't develop this way - technological empowerment from below led to success in developed nations. Technology can amplify voices, make it possible for individuals to have a voice that gets heard by central authorities.
</blockquote>

<p>I love it.</p>

<p>But I always find it disturbing that his bottom line is <em>productivity</em> -- the extent to which their communication means that they are participating in the market. </p>

<p>I write this in spite of,the obvious fact that the real goal of progressive ICT is the empowerment of people, ie, the elimination of poverty. So there is always an element of market-think undergirding the need for communication.</p>

<p>But by understanding people&#39;s lives in terms of an economic equation, there&#39;s some unquantifiable (romantic, perhaps) aspect of communications-based development that is lost. Because, after all, if we were all well fed and clothed, we&#39;d still be suffering without the ability to communicate.</p>

  <h2>Researching Flies, and Colorblindness 101</h2>
  <p>Drosphilia researchers have a leg up on web designers. </p>

<p>Well, at least they&#39;ve got a decent explanation of colorblindness. A <a title="Colorblind Barrier Free" href="http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/#redundant2">short paper on colorblind audiences</a> was written a few years ago for researchers presenting their findings on the very latest in the world of flies. The guidelines are easy to understand, and the changes are easy to incorporate.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit:</p>

<blockquote class="large">
"There are always colorblind people among the audience and readers. There should be more than TEN colorblinds in a room with 250 people. (50% male and 50% female) There is a good chance that the paper you submit may go to colorblind reviewers. Supposing that your paper will be reviewed by three white males (which is not unlikely considering the current population in science), the probability that at least one of them is colorblind is whopping 22%! ... When preparing your presentations (papers, slides, web pages etc.), please take this into account. Here are some comments on how to make figures and presentations colorblind friendly.

<p>I would also recommend a quick look at the <a href="http://www.toledo-bend.com/colorblind/Ishihara.html">Ishihara test for colorblindness</a> for a shot-in-the arm understanding. </p>

  <h2>Branding Advocacy</h2>
  <p>Here&#39;s an interesting article from an old Harvard Business School <em>Working Knowledge</em> series. It&#39;s about branding, which from my perspective is a very diffucult thing to incorporate in online communications. </p>

<p>Websites and emails, for example, need to reflect some kind of graphical relationship with the rest of your organization. But I think they should also reflect a &quot;tone&quot; of your organization and its role in the world. </p>

<p>This article deals with these concerns in a broader sense. Here&#39;s a bit: </p>

<blockquote class="large">
One of the additional challenges nonprofit brands face is that they must appeal to a broader array of stakeholders. Nonprofit brands have a dual objective: to enhance fundraising and to ensure the implementation of the organization's mission. In addition, nonprofit organizations tend to be more decentralized, with little formal hierarchy. This can mean that implementing activities that protect the brand or attempting to update or modify the brand often meets with resistance internally. In some cases, highly decentralized organizations such as Medecins Sans Frontiers [also known as Doctors without Borders] depend on their brand to provide organization cohesion. The brand is the glue holding the components of the global organization together.</blockquote>

  <h2>An Authoritarian "Third Way" on the Internet</h2>
  <p>There&#39;s an old dream held by certain Englishmen of the Enlightenment: the perfect prison, the panopticon. In the panopticon, every cell can be seen into by a single guard standing in the center tower. But the prisoners can&#39;t see into the guard tower. The prisoners begin to monitor themselves; they must assume that they are always being watched. </p>

<p>The regulation of the internet has become just such a panopticon in China, where about 100 million regular internet users  are dealing with an extremely sophisticated network of monitors and police-state software that regulates their activity.</p>

<p>Worse, it appears that a rather large industry has grown up around the censorship, because all businesses realize they&#39;ve got a lot to lose if their employees get busted for reading about human rights at work. So corporations, like individuals, are participating in their own punishment.  </p>

<p>It was interesting to note that this is all wholly different from (and much more successful than) other authoritarian countries, which regulate by simply restricting access. Here&#39;s a bit form the article:</p>

<blockquote class="large">
"Its filtering system has become at once more refined and comprehensive over time, building a matrix of controls that stifles access to information deemed illegitimate by authorities," said a study released April 14 by the OpenNet Initiative, a partnership among scholars at Harvard Law School, the University of Toronto and Cambridge University.

China's rulers foster the impression of an all-encompassing ability to monitor Internet usage. Arrests of Internet "subversives" are widely reported. And no one denies persistent but unconfirmed reports that as many as 30,000 government employees toil at monitoring Internet traffic.

"They want you to think that every bit of your activity is tracked. That's what has everybody nervous. If they say something in a chat room, will they get in trouble?" said Anne Stevenson-Yang, who until recently headed the U.S. Information Technology Office, a nonprofit trade group in Beijing representing U.S. information technology businesses operating in China.

As Internet usage explodes, billion-dollar businesses have emerged, offering gateways, news sites, auctions and other services. Private Internet tycoons, reliant on government approval and fearful of criminal prosecution, ensure that online postings don't broach sensitive topics. They hire online moderators with lightning-fast fingers on the "delete" key.

  <h2>The Law and Blogging</h2>
  <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation has just released a great &quot;Legal Guide For Bloggers,&quot; which goes into some of the concepts that you might not be familiar with. </p>

<p>If your organization is getting into blogging as a way to advocate your cause (and give honest PR, retain donors, keep employees up-to-date, keep volunteers enthused etc. ...), this is something to keep around the office, preferably near the water cooler, coffee pot or toilet, where it might actually get read.</p>

<p>Those of us who did the journalism school thing can tell you: media law ain&#39;t that much fun. But it is good to know, for example, that if you quote someone saying something slanderous, you can be legally tried for libel, which is, in fact, worse. (Libel is printed, slander spoken.)</p>

<p>As they are quick to point out: &quot;None of this should stop you from blogging. Freedom of speech is the foundation of a functioning democracy ...&quot; (I would also point out that it is a good thing to have in a poorly functioning democracy.)
<blockquote class="large">
&quot;Whether you&#39;re a newly minted blogger or a relative old-timer, you&#39;ve been seeing more and more stories pop up every day about bloggers getting in trouble for what they post. ... The difference between you and the reporter at your local newspaper is that in many cases, you may not have the benefit of training or resources to help you determine whether what you&#39;re doing is legal. And on top of that, sometimes knowing the law doesn&#39;t help - in many cases it was written for traditional journalists, and the courts haven&#39;t yet decided how it applies to bloggers.&quot;</blockquote></p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>How "Marketing" Can Help Eliminate Extreme Poverty</h2>
  <p>When Nonprofit X goes to county Y and begins handing out seeds and fertilizer to farmers as part of an agricultural intervention during a famine, how does Nonprofit X know that they aren&#39;t causing a greater problem or ignoring a better solution? Perhaps it turns out the fertilizer is more valuable when it is sold on the nearby market than it is in the ground. Perhaps microloans or digging new wells are better solutions that the population is looking for.</p>

<p>At any rate, even in this very simple hypothetical situation, it is clear that you have to <em>go there</em>. You have to ask and investigate. You should, in short, behave in a manner very similar to that of a market researcher. In fact, if we undertook all of our development decisions with a rigorous marketing mindset, we&#39;d be going in far fewer circles with misused money.</p>

<p>This is the gist of a thought-provoking article from the Harvard Business School on the concept of marketing being used in human development situations involving poverty. I think it is especially pertinent for folks involved with technology and communications because of the heavy (though often overlooked) influence of advertising and marketing in all media.</p>

<p>I would call this a process of evaluation, but the &quot;marketing&quot; concept works well.</p>

<p>In many poverty-reduction programs, be they governmental, philanthropic or academic, the decision making about method -- <em>how</em> to alleviate poverty -- comes from the top down. This makes sense in many ways, and I&#39;m certainly thankful for the developed world&#39;s research institutions, mulling and muttering in their thinktanks about how to best deal with poor farmers and streetworkers around the world.</p>

<p>But programs have to take all of their stakeholders into account when it comes to crafting policy -- and that should mean subjecting proposed solutions to the &quot;market&quot; of consumers -- the population in poverty. In traditional markets, this process is essential, because bad ideas don&#39;t make money and are necessarily reformed or removed from the market. But in many governmental and philanthropic situations, bad ideas can thrive.</p>

<p>This is a concept of including the population you are serving the in the program decisions that you are making. It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit:</p>

<blockquote>"We're making the important distinction of replacing the exchange paradigm with an intervention paradigm, where we say we're intervening to change lives, not to change consumer choices.

... Four billion people are outside the exchange network. But it's not as though these folks have nothing to do with marketing. Somebody is approaching them. Somebody might approach a poor subsistence farmer in Uganda to say, 'We want to give you some agricultural aid. We want to give you a loan.'

There again, why is advocacy important? Because even in that case, what we find is that they have already decided what's good for the farmer. They already decided that what's good for the farmer is these kinds of implements, these kinds of equipment, this kind of loan. In fact, the farmer may say, 'Given everything else, that's not exactly the kind of output that is going to enhance my life. I want security and food for the family first, before I become this terrific entrepreneur.'"

  <h2>What The Hell Is RSS?</h2>
  <p>There&#39;s a good discussion going on now at <a href="http://www.techsoup.org">TechSoup </a>about how you can use technology to increase capacity of your nonprofit. </p>

<p>Their latest focus is on RSS, which is one of the more amazing technical innovations of modern communications. If you don&#39;t know what RSS is, you&#39;re not in the loop.</p>

<p>Most notably, you are missing two things. 1.) The ability to prrocess inhuman amounts of information on a regular basis. RSS is used by many sites to create &quot;digests&quot; of (a.k.a. &quot;syndicate&quot;) their content. News sites, for example, offer these RSS &quot;feeds&quot; to sections of their newspaper. </p>

<blockquote>It's a lot like having a TiVO for your favorite sites.</blockquote>

<p>Once you subscribe to one, it appears in your RSS reader of choice. In the end, it&#39;s a lot like having a TiVO for your favorite sites -- every time you sit down and you want to read, you have a list of updated articles in front of you. No wasting your life poking around the less glamorous parts of a newspaper page. </p>

<p>2.) If you have a website that is updated regularly, you can create a RSS feed so that others can subscribe to your page. This may seem a little superfluous if you don&#39;t even know what a RSS feed is. &quot;Who would use it?&quot; Plenty of folks will, especially over the next year or two. So start writing some engaging articles for your site. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit from the Tech Soup conversation:</p>

<blockquote class="large">"If you're like most people who use the Internet, chances are you often come across new and interesting sites, but then completely forget to visit them again. Or likely you spend too much time visiting the same sites looking for new information, only to be disappointed. 

In addition, your e-mail inbox is probably flooded with messages you barely have time to read, including subscriptions to newsletters that tell you about new content available on still more Web sites. ... Wouldn't it be nice if there were an easy way to have all this information come to you and go to them in a way that was easy to manage, timely, and put the reader in control? "</blockquote>

  <p>There is an interesting discussion going on (for some time now) over at the Stanford Social Innovation Review forum about charitable donations and the new &quot;ranking systems&quot; that have emerged to help the public find the most best organizations to give to.

<blockquote class="large">"Wouldn't it be nice, as we are sitting down to write our year-end checks to our chosen causes, to have a ratings system to help us make these difficult choices? Indeed, it has long been a dream of many involved with philanthropy and charitable giving to develop such an objective set of criteria to rationalize what is inevitably a highly competitive funding process. Well, several enterprising nonprofit organizations are trying to do just that. The result? Beware of what you wish for."</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they are certainly cheaper than print -- you already have the web space and need only pay for the time it takes to post. If you already have regular emails that you are sending out to a list of subscribers, then you already have the content. By posting them to the web, you can memorialize your communication, keeping your activities transparent and engaging others.</p>

<p>By posting something to the web you are making it public and, even if it is only your staff reading it at first, this can really have a strong mobilizing effect on your organization.</p>

<p>Blogs can also help you build your fundraising mission, but, more importantly, they can also become part of your mission -- you can contribute directly to your goals by keeping a record of your creative, collaborative thoughts on the current state of things.</p>

<p>A single-subject blog will help push your organization&#39;s site to the top of the Google results, because search engines love pages that are frequently updated. People will begin to find your page more if you put more information on it -- and they will be people who are already interested in your subject.</p>

<p>Blogs are truly flexible tools: you can set up multiple blogs to serve multiple purposes. Most notable, you can have a private, group blog for internal communication and a public blog (perhaps maintained by one person) on your website.</p>

<p>Blogs help organize the web: Do you have a ever-expanding folder full of favorites that would be great to share with others concerned about your mission? Post them as you find them (with little reviews to clue people in).</p>

<p>Examples of other nonprofit blogs:</p>

<p><a href="http://http//www.citizensleague.net/"><a href="http://www.citizensleague.net/">http://www.citizensleague.net/</a></a> &quot;The Citizens League promotes the public interest in Minnesota by involving citizens in identifying and framing critical public policy choices, forging recommendations and advocating their adoption.&quot;<a href="http://community.oceana.org/"><a href="http://community.oceana.org/">http://community.oceana.org/</a></a> &quot;Organizes campaigns dedicated to restoring and protecting the world&#39;s oceans through policy advocacy, science, law and public education.</p>

  <h2>A Few Words Against Drivel and Detritus</h2>
  <p>Create usable content? It doesn&#39;t sound like a difficult goal. But upon reconsideration, it is clear that the web (in particular) has become a waste of  your time. The visual aspects of the internet are all distractions without quality content. And that means content that is useful and clear. </p>

<p>Is your website full of unclear, inconsistent, out-of-date, unrevised content? It&#39;s out of style; let&#39;s all move on together now as one happy sector. </p>

<p>So three cheers for web designer <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/">Keith Robinson&#39;s </a> focus this week on content. 
Here&#39;s a great sample from his post today: </p>

<blockquote class="large">
<strong>What Usable Content Is</strong>

    * Usable content is clear and easy to understand.
    * Usable content can bridge gaps: things like language barriers, disability and cultural differences.
    * Usable content is meaningful.
    * Usable content makes the reader feel smart.
    * Usable content is goal and audience appropriate.
    * It's thought-out, planned and constantly maintained.
    * It's fresh, light and lively.
    * It's content that is organized in a way that people understand and can get their mind around.
    * It's designed to be accessible.
    * It's reusable and shareable, readily available and easy to locate.
    * It's straightforward, open and honest and to the point.
    * It encourages feedback and is engineered for conversation.
    * It's hard work, but worthy of the job.

<strong>What Usable Content Is Not</strong>

    * Usable content is not clever, obtuse or misleading.
    * It's not marketing drivel, or bland branding messages.
    * It's not longwinded.
    * It's not written at the highest possible reading level.
    * It's doesn't use 'big words' unless they are needed.
    * It's not legalese.
    * It's not double talk.
    * It's not an afterthought.
    * It's not a mission statement.
    * It's not an org chart.
    * It's not self-centered.

  <h2>Stock Photos Anyone?</h2>
  <p>Stock photography is pretty essential for web developers and designers. If your organization doesn&#39;t have a large budget for that kind of thing (stock photos are $50-$250, usually), there are a few alternatives with a decent selection -- and the pictures are only a few bucks, if not free.</p>

<p>The best of these new, inexpensive resources is called iStock Photo. Prices are about $2, depending on the resolution you need. They have the best selection of people-pics, which are more expensive because of the model releases required. Their photos come in three sizes: those that are suitable for the web, those for small print, and high-resolution images for large-format printing jobs. <a href="http://www.istock.com">www.istock.com</a></p>

<p>Another good one is the Stock Exchange, which is actually free. They have fewer pictures of people, fewer high-quality pictures and no ability to choose lower resolution. But it&#39;s free, so start your search there. <a href="http://www.sxc.hu">http://www.sxc.hu</a></p>

<p>Another free one is the Morgue File, a &quot;public image reference archive.&quot; Lots of old newspaper pictures that have entered the public domain.

  <h2>Some Web Design Books Are Dangerous</h2>
  <p>I recently picked up a copy of the &quot;for Dummies&quot; CSS tutorial book and was disappointed to find the following in a section about using named vs. hex color values (like cornflowerblue instead of #6495ED):
<blockquote class="large">
&quot;... my advice is to just assume that pretty much everyone who&#39;ll see your web page uses IE [Internet Explorer]. Why? Because most everyone <span style="font-style: italic;">does </span>use IE<span style="font-style: italic;">.&quot; p. 79 CSS Web Design For Dummies, 2005
</span></blockquote>
Thankfully, our dear author is misinformed, or simply addled. Unfortunately, the sentiment that &quot;only Internet Explorer matters&quot; is a popular one still. New webmasters please be &#39;ware: there are alternatives to Microsoft IE, most notably <a href="http://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a> which has more than 25 million downloads and is now <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">reported by the W3C</a> to have nearly 20% usage on the internet. That&#39;s a lot of people who will be seeing a screwed up page if you only test your work in IE.</p>

<p>Apparently, people want to test and develop in IE because it simplifies life.  &quot;Your job is much easier,&quot; writes the <cite class="booktitle>Dummies</cite> author, if you only design for IE6. Indeed, browser conflicts are tough to deal with as a web developer. But let&#39;s get things straight: Internet Explorer doesn&#39;t follow standard CSS rules, which makes everyone&#39;s life much more complicated.

  <h2>Hey Buddy, Can You Spare A Secure Socket Layer?</h2>
  <p>There&#39;s always a lot of curiosity about online fundraising among organizations that are new to the web. Rightly so. Having a &quot;donate now&quot; link could be, by itself, a reason to have a nonprofit website. You can give out the address of your site with all correspondence and know that you&#39;re getting the plate passed at the same time, for much less money than a direct mailing or phone solicitation.</p>

<p>But what&#39;s the best way to do it? You could take credit cards on your site, but generally the trend for mid-to-small organizations is to outsource the process entirely. By far it appears the most common technique is to register with a service such as <a href="http://www.blogger.com/groundspring.org">groundspring.org</a> or <a href="http://www.blogger.com/networkforgood.org">networkforgood.org</a>, which take the security issue of processing credit cards out of your hands. Either of these sites provide simple setp-by-step directions and are quite reliable in our judgment. But they take at least a 3% cut of a few percent for each donation. Groundspring take 3% plus a set up fee and a recurring bill of about $15 - $30 month. Groundspring&#39;s fees come with added services: a &quot;tell a friend&quot; button for donators, the ability to give rewards for certain levels of giving, extra security and automated chariable giving receipts.</p>

<p>I&#39;d stick with one of those unless your organization is very large, recieves a large amount of funding through online donations, or has a savvy techie on staff with plenty of time. It&#39;s a good way to make sure your donations are handled accountably, which is important to donors of all stripes.</p>

<p>The &quot;donate now&quot; button is but one of the many ways to use the internet for fundraising. Regarding the wider spectrum of online fundraising, of the best articles on the subject is published by Groundspring: the <a href="http://www.groundspring.org/learningcenter/handbook.cfm">Online Fundraising Handbook</a>. It&#39;s about 100 pages and isn&#39;t shy about referring you to their &quot;competitors.&quot;</p>

  <h2>Learning internet-think in Uzbekistan</h2>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net">Digital Divide Network</a> has a wonderful, thoughtful article on the use of the internet and computers in Uzbekistan, where students and teachers face both poverty and technological illiteracy. </p>

<p>A recurring question in international technology development is the relevance and local meaning of the technology -- what if I have never used a computer? Does getting one really do anything without education behind it? More accurately, I think: How useful is my new laptop if it is the only source of light in my home? (That&#39;s a <a href="http://laptop.media.mit.edu/">real example</a>, I&#39;m afraid.)</p>

<p>Technology is a tool and a process. The use of technology requires learning a skillset. This article provides an incisive look at just how hard this education can be in the real world.  </p>

<blockquote class="large">Still struggling to free itself from a Soviet educational model, Uzbekistan's school system is on the verge of disintegration. Teacher salaries in the regions can average $20 a month. Few schools have working heat to warm them through the cold months, and electricity outages during the winter are the rule rather than the exception. Textbooks are often out-of-date or unavailable.

The Soviet system -- which did install equipment in many schools long ago -- saw computers as an end to themselves. Students were taught basic programming in "informatics" classes. Given their primitive state, the concept of using the computers for lessons other than those specifically about computers was never offered nor supported. For most of the day, computers remained untouched -- gathering dust in a locked classroom, or occasionally displayed to visiting delegations as evidence of progress. This attitude towards computers remains to this day.</blockquote>

  <h2>Growing Your Nonprofit: and Alternative Model</h2>
  <p>How do nonprofits grow? That&#39;s a much discussed — and much answered question. There are thousands of books, articles, consultants even entire schools devoted to the subject of growing your nonprofit.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s not much to growth if you don&#39;t have a similar rise in creating change. And growth doesn&#39;t necessarily make an organization stronger in the nonprofit world.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the idea of Jane Wei-Skillern, at least, and she has the research to back it up. Her investigation into several national nonprofits has led her to appreciate the &quot;networked&quot; model of development over one of scale. It&#39;s about who you know, basically -- and not being afraid to actually stop doing some services that other organizations might do better if they had your help and guidance.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit:
<blockquote class="large">
&quot;Previous research with colleagues on growth suggested that growth does not necessarily translate into greater social value creation. Based on interviews and a survey done on nonprofit leaders, managers often cited a preference for growth by branching, i.e., replicating the organization from one site to another and maintaining central control and ownership of the new units.</p>

<p>&quot;What Wei-Skillern and her research colleagues found, however, was that growth did not always lead to the benefits the organizations had anticipated. For example, many organizations anticipated that fundraising would be easier once they were larger. In fact, fundraising did not necessarily become easier with organizational growth, yet significant new costs were created as the organization needed to now manage and coordinate operations across multiple locations.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;[One sucessful but small organization] raised the capacity of the visually impaired charities by creating an umbrella organization with a unified agenda and creating a single voice on certain issues where it was critical. But organizations still had their own brands, did their own fundraising, and were run independently.&quot;</p>

  <h2>Add A Simple Slideshow To Your Webpage</h2>
  <p>If you need to easily display slideshows online, there are a couple of options that I have recently run across. The simplest, though not as sophisticated, process is to use a site called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, which was recently acquired by Yahoo! and can be a lot of fun. You just upload your pictures and folks can link to them to form online picture-sharing communities. The best feature is that it can export to your blog or website, though the format is not as customizable as I&#39;d like.</p>

<p>The second, more complicated, option, is to go with javascript. For our purposes here, we&#39;ll assume you don&#39;t want to write a bunch of javascript yourself. Instead, <a href="http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/slideshow/">BarleyFitz</a> studio will take care of that. Just go there and upload your pictures on their site, and you&#39;ll get very straightforward instructions for inserting the resulting code in your site. Customization can make it look especially good (here&#39;s a fantastic <a href="http://randomhawk.com/stuff/randomhawk/final/">example</a> posted to a recent css forum. The fade in is especially nice). I have used BarleyFitz&#39;s javascript in some forprofit work with greta success, but is rather convoluted javascript in use, so be ready to sit down with it for a while if you want it to look really nice.</p>

<p>This type of slideshow would be good for nonprofits that need a way to showcase their activities on the web. There are other, more expensive solutions, but they are often overdesigned (with noises and animations at every click of the mouse).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit from the article, the chart is about a 60K PDF. </p>

<blockquote class="large"> 

A wide variety of software packages are available to help nonprofit organizations track program management data and outcome measures for evaluation. One advantage of an "off-the-shelf" package is that these packages are often "tried and true." Another is that the software makers often supply training and technical assistance to users. On the other hand, organizations should carefully consider whether the available packages are appropriate for their needs. In some cases, organizations may find it more useful to design their own tracking systems, although the process can be time-consuming and may require extensive technical training.

  <h2>Stop Making Crappy Ads</h2>
  <p>Stephen Pinker writes in his book <span style="font-style: italic;">How Minds Work</span> that &quot;the emotions are mechanisms that set the brains highest-level goals.&quot; This, it seems, is a good description of why small, mission-driven nonprofits exist despite the innumerable difficulties of keeping such an operation afloat. It&#39;s also an essential idea to consider when advertising your organization.</p>

<p>People are drawn to imagery and emotions that inspire them to work for a cause. If you have ever been saddled with the task of creating ads or promotional material for your organization, you would do well to keep these emotions -- not facts about your job or accomplishments -- at the front of your mind.</p>

<p>This concept is just one idea among many in an immensely useful e-book published a couple of years ago by Cause Communications called <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.agoodmanonline.com/pdf/bad_ads_low_res/BadAdsLo.pdf">Why Bad Ads Happen to Good Causes</a>. </span>It should be in every nonprofit office (unless you have the luxury of an ad department to think about such things). It covers broad ideas like the above, but it also goes into detail about using layout and text to keep people reading and engaged in your message. And it has great reviews of nonprofit ads over the last 10 years. It is, in short, an eminently readable advertising textbook for nonprofits; check it out before your next ad deadline.</p>

  <h2>The Google Game</h2>
  <p>There is no shortage of webmasters desperate to get their hard-won site noticed. After spending many sleepless nights coding and debugging a site for a nonprofit, it only makes sense that you would want it to actually show up when someone is searching for your organization&#39;s keywords. But, like much of the web-authoring career, you won&#39;t find a perfectly simple solution.</p>

<p>The science and art of ranking highly on Google has become a major industry, populated (not surprisingly) by some folks willing to do some very unsavory things to get your site listed. Here&#39;s how it works: you make the site and want to see it ranking higher; you pay a &quot;Search Engine Optimization&quot; company to get you listed on the first page of Google for certain keywords. What happens after this point will either 1.) entail rewriting most of your content and all of your title/meta/alt tags or 2.) entail the SEO company setting up false domains that feed into your site (or a number of other dirty tricks). Both will get you higher listings, but only rewriting your content (a major project in most cases) will keep you there. Some unsavory SEO techniques will actually get you banned from Google et al, making your site effectively useless. This was a major point of discussion on a recent thread at techsoup.org, which is highly recommended in general. Here&#39;s a snippet of the conversation:</p>

<blockquote class="large">While there's a lot you can do to improve your site's ranking, nobody in the world can guarantee that you'll come up with a top ranking on the first or second page of the search results. A statement like this implies that humans have complete control over the search engine ranking process, when in fact this is not true at all. However ... SEO can lead to excellent results without it having to be a complicated process. </blockquote>

<p>You can find the thread under the &quot;web building&quot; forum, but you&#39;ll have to browse for the search engine-related threads. The above conversation touches on some very good, basic techniques of search engine optimization, such as the use of the title tags and keyword-rich copy. There are other guides available online for sure, but the best resource I&#39;ve found is the 2004 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764567586/qid=1110985943/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-5132674-2028701?v=glance&s=books&amp;n=507846">Search Engine Optimization for Dummies</a>. If you&#39;re new to search engine optimization, just sit down with that and apply a little of what you learn to your site. Even just an afternoon&#39;s work can make your site several times more visible on search engines and result in greatly increased traffic on the web. If you&#39;re really willing to work at it, you can get an incredible amount of publicity for your organization through your website.</p>

  <h2>Accessibility Is Important</h2>
  <p>If you or your nonprofit is concerned about your pages being readable to people with limited sight or non-graphical browsers, you should check out this classic book on accessibility. <a href="http://joeclark.org/book/sashay/serialization/">Building Accessible Websites</a> explains in clear, detailed steps how to get your site up to speed. And it doesn&#39;t have to mean a major foray into tangled html. Just add some alt tags and title tags, and you&#39;ve cleared the first hurdle. From Chapter 6:
<blockquote class="large">The importance of making absolutely all the images on your Website accessible cannot be underestimated. This simple action alone gets you more than halfway toward an accessible site. You have to do it <em>correctly</em>, but even if you skip every other accessibility step, your sites immediately become fundamentally accessible.</blockquote></p>

<p>Unfortunately, hundreds of major sites have not caught on to this and persist in using images for navigation without providing alt text or title text. It&#39;s obviously not good business to turn away disabled customers, and in some cases (as in web sites made by the government) it may be illegal. And besides, it is always good for search engines to have your images described in the text.</p>

  <h2>What is ICT?</h2>
  <p>ICT is Information Communication Technology, literally. </p>

<p>More generally, ICT is at the core of a movement that seeks to provide access to technology for people who would normally not have access to it. This, in turn, is part of a larger movement against poverty and inequality. </p>

<p>A great introduction comes from the (via the Digital Divide network); here&#39;s a bit:</p>

<blockquote class="large">

The uneven availability of access to information and communication technologies among the world's population has great importance to public policy and the well being of nations and individuals worldwide. Of particular importance, from a global "public welfare" perspective, is unrealized potential economic and human development that could be achieved through information communication technologies. On an individual basis, this forgone development activity translates into higher rates of poverty, poorer health, lower literacy and quality of life than is necessary.

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>Is Open Source Software Ready?</h2>
  <p>Yes, it is. </p>

<p>Open source software is free. It is supported by communities of developers, not corporations. And it is ready.</p>

<p>Sure, sometimes, it doesn&#39;t work. Development can stop abruptly on a project, and support can be limited -- because it&#39;s free. </p>

<p>But often, open source software is better than the overloaded, buggy programs put out by the big guys (Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, etc.).  </p>

<p>With a little bit of online research, there is often an open-source alternative to expensive programs that are needed for programs in rural/poor/developing areas.</p>

<p>What open source gives you (besides a free or cheap program) is a connection with software develpers that are, typically, committed to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">cause</a> that appears to be very much in line with the general philosophies underlying ICT and development work. </p>

<p>Power to the people. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit from recent BBC article describing the use of open source software in Manchester schools, and the government research that supports its use. (Hard not to like thousands of Pounds in savings, right?)</p>

<p>I say, if it&#39;s good enough for Manchester, it&#39;s good enough for the world. Now if only there were open source programs comparable to Intel&#39;s Teach to the Future Program, which claims to have trained 2 million teachers. Too bad they&#39;re all trained in super-expensive proprietary software. 
<blockquote class="large"></p>

<p>Software licenses cost Parrs Wood [elementary school] about 30,000 pounds each year, less than half the cost if no OSS [open source software] were deployed, according to figures in the recent Becta [UK education research group] report.</p>

<p>Only recently has the school become satisfied that OSS is now sufficiently well developed to meet classroom and office needs and provides a viable alternative to licensed software.</p>

<p>With governors&#39; support and encouragement, the school is adopting OSS more completely over the next three years, including the eventual replacement of Windows by an OSS desktop, which will be a significant change.</p>

  <h2>The United Nations Report on Technology And Human Development</h2>
  <p>Here&#39;s a great PDF version of a slightly dated -- but far-seeing -- report from the UN on the uses of emerging technologies in human development. It&#39;s optimism is tempered with a good deal of experience -- it is clear that there is no single, technological solution to the problems of extreme poverty and inequality. Rather, technology is presented as being a key aspect of contemporary international development scholarship and praxis. This perspective, combined with their appreciation of the multitude of ways that technology is manifest, makes it an extremely worthwhile read.</p>

  <h2>Paul Farmer: A (Deserving) Nonprofit Celebrity</h2>
  <p>Paul Farmer is an amazing member of the &quot;nonprofit community,&quot; famous in his own circles of public health and international development. The Stanford Social Innovation Review, (an excellent magazine) has a lovely extended interview with him about his work and his perspective. If you have not read about his work, this is a good introduction. </p>

<p>What makes his vision so wonderful, I think, is his ability to keep the big picture right in front of him. He does not let his job come in the way of his purpose. As a public health practicioner, he says this means 2 things: 1.) Remaining a practitioner (and not becoming a more profitable, detached, consultant. ) and 2.) &quot;doing what it takes&quot; to make sure that health needs are being met in communities in need. For him this mean the &quot;controversial&quot; practice of  monitoring patient&#39;s perscription drug use. By being more in the post-treatment phase of his patients lives, he has forced himself into a nontraditional role that works. The article touches briefly on this point, but it is captured much better in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0520235509/ref=sib_rdr_dp/002-0718080-9164864?%5Fencoding=UTF8&no=283155&me=ATVPDKIKX0DER&st=books">&quot;Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor.&quot;</a> If you have any interest in international health and development, this is a great read. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit from the Stanford article: </p>

<blockquote class="large">
In 1987, physician and anthropologist Paul Farmer founded Partners in Health to treat tuberculosis and other infectious diseases among Haiti's rural poor. Since that time, his organization has expanded to care and advocate for the world's poorest and sickest, in sites as diverse as Siberian prisons, Peruvian shantytowns, and Boston's inner-city neighborhoods. The organization has also clarified its broader goal: to address the inequity and injustice that underlie much of human suffering. </blockquote>
