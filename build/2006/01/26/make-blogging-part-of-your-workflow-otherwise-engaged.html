I've been using <a href="http://www.alexandrasamuel.com/20050522/make-blogging-part-of-your-workflow/">this tutorial</a> from Alexandra Samuel to set up a workflow that allows you to 1.) post to your blog 2.) post to del.ico.us and 3.) save all your links using <a href="http://www.spurl.com">spurl.com</a>, all at the same time. This, I think will work well for a new biofuels community website that I'm working on with people in (and around) Piedmount Biofuels here in NC. Pardon any mess I make while I'm tinkering.
