<img src='/wp-content/uploads/consultantcommonstn.jpg' alt='Consultant-commons' />A beta project from CompuMentor, <a href="http://www.consultantcommons.org">Consultant Commons</a> provides a platform to share and collaborate on resources around nonprofit technology consulting. I wish I could recommend this site, but it has a long way to go before it really works well. For now, at least, there are a few useful documents, but most of the stuff is geared toward nonprofit consultants.
