          <h2>In Praise of Shitty Programmers</h2>
          <p>There&#39;s this great movie called A Beautiful Mind that I saw once, and in the last few months I&#39;ve been quoting it a few times when talking about my programming career. Overall it&#39;s a great story, but the one scene that really gets me is when he (John Nash, famous mathematician) is standing in front of a class at Princeton and he puts a particularly complex problem on the board. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the first day of class, and he puts the problem on the board, and then explains how complicated the problem is. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;This problem will take some of you a few months to solve, ... for others, it will take the rest of your natural lives.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Assuming that I could ever even get into a Princeton math class (uh, no), this would be when I walked out. I would drop it and go back to something easier to BS, like a user experience research class. </p>

<p>I mean, what fun is working on things that you can never really GET? Things that you aren&#39;t born with? </p>

<p>Anyway, this has basically been my experience since I&#39;ve moved to San Francisco. As in, totally getting my brain fried by the stuff I see other programmers doing &mdash; programmers who were just born with it. I meet guys in coffeeshops and they tell me casually about the device drivers they&#39;re writing. (Seriously, he was building an android or something.) </p>

<p>And thus, in spite of really really wanting to be a great programmer, and thinking that I was pretty good at it, I now realize that<strong> I am a shitty programmer, and I always will be</strong>. I mean, I think I&#39;m probably around the 50th percentile  of programmers, but the problem is that <strong>I know about 1% of there actually is to learn in Computer Science</strong>. I am the guy who spends the rest of his life trying to figure out the problem on the board. And this was not a good realization. I actually was pretty depressed when I thought about it this way. I was just so much happier when I thought I was a l33t hacker a few years ago. </p>

<p>I am consoled somewhat by the fact that you are probably a shitty programmer too (jk jk jk), but in the last week I had three much more useful realizations: </p>

<h3> When it is ok to be a shitty programmer </h3>  

<ol>
<li><strong>You absolutely love it.</strong> I saw this guy walking down the street with a beat up cello the other day. And I was thinking about this problem and saying something to myself like, "I'll bet he is probably in the bottom 30% of all cello players." This guy probably will never play Bach's cello suites. But of course, he was on his way to a great gig and was gonnna have an awesome time with has prog-chamber-rock outfit. With a big ass grin on his face. That's reason enough to work on some impossible problem long after everyone else has it figured out &mdash; just cause it's a fun process. </li>
<li> <strong>You bring something else to the table.</strong> If you are a shitty programmer but you can talk to people and help them collaborate, maybe do a bit of design, or do design research, or you just have a strong creative vision &mdash; these are all qualities that are missing from some of the greatest programming minds. </li>
<li><strong>You are working on something important to people.</strong> This is the point I was making a month ago about all of the recent web standards fuss: <a href="http://www.unthinkingly.com/2007/12/21/ok-nevermind-actually-the-future-is-in-the-past/">Amateurs are doing more important things than you are, fancypants. And that's so rad.</a> I mean, imagine that you are a brilliant programmer working on device drivers for some machine that counts money all day for some investment banker or something. Who cares? You can write a million programs that count a bazillion dollars and you will die really rich, but you won't DO anything. Find projects that are really important, gigs that actually impact people's lives in a positive way and you are already DOING much more important work than the most brilliant programmers (who are meanwhile busy deep in their cubicles, dying rich).
</li></ol>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. <strong>It&#39;s not OK to write shitty programs.</strong> People deserve good software. That&#39;s part of the point: if you are a shitty programmer, fess up. Find your role on a team. But once you have crossed some basic threshold of capability, and you can build something that is useful, and usable, and you have a great time doing it ... then you can really get to work making a difference in the world with your work.</p>

<p>And anyway, being academically in the top 10% of your field typically produces completely perfect, completely conservative, crap. Right?</p>
