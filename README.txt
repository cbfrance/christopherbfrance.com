It seems I stopped writing this blog about the time that I moved to the SF Bay Area. That leaves it as a moderately useful record of my personal line of thinking. 2I no longer really feel motivated to write "blog posts." What else could I write? This has started to become a pile of old content. At least they are in markdown with decent metadata frontmatter and file naming conventions. I hope to make it back into something that helps me create something new by taking apart the old stuff, a de-authoring environment, a space for for unthinking.
