      <p>For the User Experience people: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx1WveKV7aE">Bill Buxton is a genius.</a> Got me sketching. (And redefined &quot;sketching.&quot;) 1.5 hr. lecture. Teaser: includes the phrase &quot;Charlton Heston flying through the air.&quot; Oh and also please buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371">Sketching User Experiences</a>. Operators are standing by. </p>

<p>For the type nerds: <a href="http://typeculture.com/academic_resource/movies/">Erik Speikermann is my idea of what real men are like.</a> The opening jingle made me shoot beer through my nose. 6 minutes. Just watch it. Check out his <a href="http://www.spiekermann.com/mten/index.html">blog</a> too. </p>

<p>For Architecture Geeks: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8639555925486210852">Stewart Brand</a> is brilliant and insane. Fun SF footage too. Feature length PBS type thingy: Part 1 of 6.</p>

<p>For Anyone Who Uses a Computer: <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=engelbart&emb=0#">Doug Engelbart is my hero.</a> &quot;Dealing lightning with both hands,&quot; indeed: this is the public debut of the freaking mouse, hypertext, screensharing <em>and</em> the networked office. This is where it all went down, in 1968 San Francisco (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Dormouse-Said-Counterculture-Personal/dp/0670033820">think about it</a>), to a standing ovation in a auditorium full of geeks who had their minds blown. (Bonus points if you know Stewart Brand&#39;s connection.) Long and really boring honestly. Use <a href="http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/1968Demo.html">this</a> like TV Guide, but watch the video on Youtube. If you look close you can see Skype crash.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve felt for a long time that education is the most important vehicle for social change. I mean, really how else does anything actually get done? You&#39;ve got to have some kick ass teachers along the way, or you&#39;re gonna be a vegetable. And vegetabledom happens to entire societies. Watch out. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m a little depressed that I don&#39;t get to work directly in the education sector anymore &mdash; I used to have a great time working on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_evaluation">educational evaluation</a> projects, and for a time I was a mentor. Now I&#39;m a full time geek staring at an LCD, and I don&#39;t so much ever get the thrill of seeing kids make the grand connections. (read: manipulating young minds, bwah ha ha.) </p>

<p>Anyway, just watched a great TED video from Dave Eggers. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/233">Give it 20 minutes</a> and tell me if you don&#39;t want to sign up to be a volunteer. It&#39;s a hilarious talk anyway, even if you hate kids. </p>

      <h2><a href="/2007/12/02/move-to-san-francisco/">Why I moved to San Francisco</a> </h2>
      <span class='timestamp'> 
        Dec  2 2007
      </span>
      <p>&quot;Move to San Francisco&quot; seems to be the advice that I&#39;ve been giving to pretty much all of the geek + activisty folks that I know. There have been really great conferences like <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a> and <a href="http://compostmodern.org/">CompostModern</a>, green <a href="http://greendrinks.org/">socialite stuff</a> and <a href="http://www.greenfestivals.org/">Green Fest</a>, a great cycling scene, gorgeous coastline, sustainable agriculture galore, municipal freaking <em>composting</em>, local beer/coffee/chocolate/veggies/everything, the legendary queer scene, the legendary political art scene, an awesome, active <a href="http://www.aiga.org/">AIGA</a> chapter, killer public transport, a hilarious mix of psychedelic and high-tech history... It&#39;s all been even more incredible than I&#39;d hoped. This city is just completely alive and thriving with all kinds of brilliant geeky people doing Good Things. ... You should come, really. </p>

<p>I got here sometime in the summer for a new job doing design/programming/research at this fantastic little <a href="http://www.boltpeters.com/">UX shop</a>. It was completely serendipitous how I got the job, but that&#39;s a better story told in a bar than a blog. I&#39;ve got a little studio off of <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/traveler/guide/sf/neighborhoods/mission_24th.shtml">24th Street</a> in the Mission, which is about as wonderful as city living can be, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Best of all, when I moved I got rid of my damned phone and car, two of my least favorite things in the world. :) </p>

<p>For the last month I&#39;ve been working intensely on a complete rewrite of a research tool called <a href="http://ethnio.com">Ethnio</a>. Ethnio is intended to make online user experience research cheaper and easier, and I&#39;m pretty damn happy with the progress that we&#39;ve made. I&#39;ll post a link as soon as we&#39;re out of private beta. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been spending most of my day&#39;s working with a few geniuses at <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> down on Market Street (including rails expert <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/">josh susser</a>.) I love being around people that are much smarter than I am; it makes learning impossible to avoid. And this happens positively <em>all the time</em> in SF. Seriously, I&#39;m in a Valencia street coffeshop now and I could probably ask the guy sitting next to me for help with the code I&#39;m working on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be posting some more technical things here soon from my Ruby on Rails adventures, as well as some of the incredible graphic design stuff that I&#39;ve been stumbling onto lately. I&#39;m hoping to get back into blogging more now that things have calmed down with the move and with the beta release of Ethnio. But regardless, really, you should do yourself a favor and figure out how to uproot yourself for California. Come by get a beer and a burrito sometime, won&#39;t you?</p>
