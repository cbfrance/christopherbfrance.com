      <span class='timestamp'> 
        Sep  9 2009
      </span>
      <p>In October I&#39;ll be geeking out at the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/">ICCM 09</a>, the first International Conference on Crisis Mapping. The conference is &quot;harnessing mobile platforms, computational linguistics, geospatial technologies, and visual analytics to power effective early warning for rapid response to complex humanitarian emergencies.&quot; </p>

<p>If you&#39;re scratching your head wondering what the field of crisis mapping is all about ... you&#39;re not alone! Good thing Patrick Meier has proposed a <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/proposing-crisis-mapping/">sketch of the field</a>. You have to love a guy who literally defines a field. Patrick is a collaborator at Ushahidi and Swift, and I have really been fortunate to see him at work, particularly his leadership in bridging academic and hacker-practitioner communities in this &quot;crisis&quot; space. It&#39;s the same thing that is making everyone so excited about this conference. Thanks, Patrick. </p>

<p>Cross-pollination at these conferences is incredibly important to our success. We&#39;re doing many of the same things over and over, with innovative twists appropriate to our context. We just don&#39;t know each other. Now we get to meet and work together for three days. I think it&#39;s terribly exciting because of an increasing sense that <em>we can all be doing these things much better</em>. </p>

<p>See also Crisis Camp West (Watch <a href="http://crisiscamp.org/">this space</a>, I think.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s this from the ICCM conference site:</p>

<blockquote>
The purpose of the 3-day conference to be held in Cleveland on October 16-18 is to bring together the most engaged practitioners, scholars, software developers and policymakers at the cutting edge of crisis mapping to define the future of the field along with best practices and lessons learned. We expect over 50 organizations to be represented and for multiple partnerships to be formed on specific projects during the conference. Please note this conference is by invitation only. See below for a list of invited partners.
</blockquote>

<p>I hope to meet a few of my friends that I don&#39;t get to see enough, and meet a few new people working on great stuff. Check out the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/profiles/members/">people that are involved</a> and some of the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/group/signupforignitetalks/forum/topics/add-your-ignite-talk-proposal">planned talks</a>. Probably there will be a lot of discussion about how to use <a href="http://swiftapp.org">Swift</a>, and I might be demoing a new project about the rapid deployment of applications like Ushahidi and Meedan.</p>

<del datetime="2009-09-11T12:12:36+00:00">Come out and hack on some amazing software! </del>

<p><strong>Correction: You can&#39;t come out and hack because (upon closer reading) it&#39;s apparently a closed conference. Frankly I&#39;m disappointed.</strong></p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.sokwanele.com/">Zimbabwe Election Watch</a> is doing a pretty amazing job of aggregating media reports about the Zimbabwe elections and using Google Maps to present the results. I&#39;m both impressed and depressed about it. </p>

<p>I have a love for maps because they can be the most rich, yet easy-to-understand communication tools. <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int">ReliefWeb</a>, a website devoted to distributing time-sensitive information about humanitarian crises, is an excellent resource for insightful maps and infographics. You can sign up to receive email updates of all their new maps. Stuff like this map showing displaced persons in the DRC.  </p>

<p>Maps in the mailbox? Wonderful. </p>

      <p>This is minor news in most contexts: <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth </a>(the software power tool that feels like a toy) has been released for the Mac. </p>

<p>Aside from the obvious usefulness of this release, this signals a money-where-their-mouth-is confirmation thae Google isn&#39;t just reinforcing Microsoft&#39;s monopolistic dominance. </p>

<p>Google has offered a wealth of opportunities for open source, multi-platform development. But their unusual business model (offer almost <em>everything</em> for free) means that they&#39;ve been targeting the largest mass of computer users &mdash; Microsoft-bound users, that is. </p>

<p>As (Open Source Journalist) <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/">Glyn Moody </a>wrote recently:</p>

<blockquote class="large">Google's software is heavily weighted towards Microsoft Windows. Programs like Google Earth and Picasa are only available under Windows, and its latest, most ambitious foray, the Google Pack, is again only for Microsoft's operating system. This means that every time Google comes out with some really cool software, it is reinforcing Microsoft's hold on the desktop. Indeed, we are fast approaching the point where the absence of GNU/Linux versions of Google's programs are a major disincentive to adopt an open source desktop.</blockquote>

<p>Glad to see that little bit of criticism go so out of date so quickly. Now, Google, a Linux release, please.</p>

<p>Key system requirements: OS X 10.4 (Tiger), a 400-MHz processor, and 16 MB of video RAM, minimum &mdash; essentially, even a G3 iBook from mid-2002 should be able to handle it &mdash; but they recommend more than 1.5 GHz, 32 megs of video and a fairly speedy broadband connection. I&#39;ve been restraining myself from acquiring the leaked beta, but I&#39;m going to download it now.</p>

      <p>I have spent an awful lot of (relative) time writing about maps in this space over the last month, but this one really caught my eye. </p>

<p>Declan Butler has recently worked with the journal <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/index.html">Nature </a></em>to publish a map of the H5N1 avian influenza virus outbreaks over the last two years. He used some data from various government sources, an MS Access database, and the ever popular (astoundingly fun) <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> application.</p>

<p>This is why the new breed of online maps are such wonderful tools for creating understanding: With a little technical work (and perhaps a lot of fact-checking), you can create simple yet information-rich presentation of a pandemic that is affecting millions.</p>

<p>Good writeups of the new map can be found on the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060105/full/060105-1.html">Nature website</a> and at <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003959.html">WorldChanging</a>.  (You can find details of the programming side on Declan&#39;s <a href="http://declanbutler.info/blog/?p=16">Blog</a>.)</p>

<p>The trendiness of &quot;mashups&quot; is frustrating to me when I see it only being applied to giving superfluous but super-detailed information about movie times and local gas prices.   </p>

<p>In this anticapitalist, curmudegonly spirit I appreciate journalist Glyn Moody&#39;s alternative description of Google Earth &quot;conceptually simple scaffolding for other data to be brought together and displayed.&quot; As he points out in his <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/">bioinformatics/open source blog</a>, this type of platform has incredible implications for the sharing of scientific resources. Like all open source concepts/applications, this has the greatest impact on science in the developing world, where resources  remain scant. </p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.shim.bc.ca/">Community Mapping Network </a> (CMN)provides an online mapping application that allows folks in British Columbia, Canada, to create and edit information about environmental resources in their areas. </p>

<p>The application is used for sustainable city planning efforts and other types of environmentally-sensitive decision making. </p>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, the CMN also hosts a directory of international projects, which you can contact and volunteer with if you&#39;re so inclined. These are mostly intended to &quot;collect natural resource information about fish and wildlife species and sensitive riparian, fresh water and marine habitats.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s a Canadian grassroots effort, and it&#39;s a wonderful thing to see. I especially like their broader mission to empower communities environmentally: </p>

<blockquote class="large">Mapping typically takes place in rural and urban areas to assist planning sustainable communities and should also be used as a vehicle for empowering community conservation and stewardship of natural resources."</blockquote>

<p>I love this site and their model (although some of their Macromedia ColdFusion mapping applications didn&#39;t work on my computer.)</p>

<p>I believe that this type of project might be feasible for other types of community projects or collaboratives. Perhaps GPS cellphones and some server-side GIS could make a popular urban system investigating, perhaps, an environmental justice problem.</p>

      <p>Being a great way to communicate quickly, maps can also be incredibly dense with information.  When they are put to a wholesome use, maps, like apple pie and puppies, deserve to have a special place in every home.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the incredible work coming out of the Dutch group <a href="http://www.mappingworlds.nl/">Mapping Worlds</a>. They&#39;ve beautifully mapped global poverty, international migration, and civil conflict. They even have a special section of maps for Millennium Development Goals!  </p>

<p>These Nederlanders have their act together. </p>

<p><img alt="oda_june2005.jpg" src="/images/oda_june2005.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is their fabulous map of the failed funding effort being undertaken by the developed world for poverty relief. (You can find a larger one on <a href="http://www.mappingworlds.nl/">their site</a>. You know you want to.) It&#39;s shameful, really. </p>

<p>If you enjoy this and have a second or two, be sure to toy with their animated, more robust version at the Center For Global Development, where they have <a href="http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/cdi/_maps/">mapped an index of international commitment</a> to the Development Goals. No really, check that last link, it&#39;s fantastic. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what they say about this project: <blockquote class="large"> The Commitment to Development Index reminds the world that reducing poverty in developing countries is about far more than giving money. Trade, investment, migration, security, environment, and technology policies matter, too. Now in its third year, the CDI ranks 21 of the richest nations on their performance in each policy area, giving you the big picture. View the rankings in charts, learn what the Index rewards and penalizes, compare country report cards, and post comments or suggestions.</blockquote> </p>

<p>It&#39;s an amazing bit of scripting, for sure.</p>

      </span>
      <p><em>With a nod to International Blogging for Disaster Relief Day (Friday, Sept. 2).  ... Crossposted on the DDN list.</em></p>

<p>I am beginning research into ways in which mapping technologies like GIS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gis">wikipedia: GIS</a>) are being used (and can potentially be used) to help avert or cope with humanitarian disasters.</p>

<p>The tragedy of New Orleans has given me some insight into the potential and limitations for this use of geospatial technologies. <img alt="New Orleans below sea level" src="/images/NO-below-Sea-level.jpg" />
Thanks to Andy Carvin for applying his blogging/networking skills to this problem and prompting this line of thinking (<a href="http://katrina05.blogspot.com/">The Katrina Aftermath Blog</a>) . Recent discussion on the <a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/community/digitaldivide">Digital Divide List</a> of geocoded pictures has also been stimulating.</p>

<p>GIS is a sophisticated, robust technology that is being used to map and analyze data in numerous fields, especially environmental studies and public health. One of the most compelling features of GIS research is that it takes advantage of the contemporary wealth of data that is collected by all kinds of environmental monitors. (eg: weather is monitored constantly, and thus existing weather datasets can be mapped geospatially to discover, for example, patterns in flooding or to predict the best time to plant crops.)</p>

<p>New Orleans has for some time been the subject of extensive GIS research because of its precarious position below sea level. The availability of this technology has, I feel certain, prevented or alleviated numerous problems created by the hurricane (perhaps, for example, by helping prepare the safest evacuation routes years ago). I am interested in discovering similar, existing applications for GIS in poorer parts of the world. I would also like to find discussion/research of <em>potential</em> uses, especially, again, in the context of poverty.</p>

<p><img alt="niger" src="/images/niger-small.jpg">Cusory searches of the internet  find that there certainly exists a great deal of straightforward mapping going on in terms of humanitarian crises, most notably (according to my notes) the indexes on <a href="http://www.Reliefweb.int">Reliefweb.int</a>. These are extremely useful documents for creating awareness, but they are also rich, multilayerd documents for use by the aid workers and activists that cope with these problems daily. A .pdf file of the crisis in Niger, for example, can be a great way to understand the scope of the problem, but it also can direct the triage more effectively. </p>

<p>The center for New Orleans GIS research is at Louisiana State University; they have an excellent <a href="http://www.publichealth.hurricane.lsu.edu">website</a> that distributes their GIS data to the folks in the government that need the information. I doubt that there is any much more sophisticated model of GIS research. What fascinates me is that, although I am new to GIS, it appears that there is a strong &quot;open source sensibility&quot; about most GIS-- the information is provided free (though sometimes to a limited set of users) and is intended for extended, unmonitored use. How can this be expanded and reproduced in a way that promotes human development?</p>
