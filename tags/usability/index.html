      <p>Linux and open source computing is going to have a great 2007. In spite of a few hiccups in some communities, and the astonishing lack of penetration into the mainstream brain, it is obvious that we are seeing more and more people getting it. </p>

<p>Just check out IBM&#39;s <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/linux/integration/">Linux praise page</a> if you want an overview. And governments are getting it too, in <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/01/14/korea_migrates_120k_civil_servants/">Korea</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-08-30-011-26-NW-LL-PB">Venuzela</a>, and <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=138464">India</a>. And then there is <a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/article.php/3641251">Chicago</a>. </p>

<blockquote class="large">When you think of Windows server, you think of rebooting the server, of always having to apply security patches. You think of viruses ... Linux and Solaris prove to be a lot less headaches than any other platform.¬ù <span class="attribution">Amy Niersbach, Chicago geek-honcho</span></blockquote>

<p>Of course, it is a bunch of elitist BS to pretend that the only reason people don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; desktop Linux is because they are just ignorant &mdash; Linux is hard. Switching is hard-ish. </p>

<p>These governments are not doing something that is totally obvious &mdash; they are, but contrast, pioneers, and they are taking no small risk in putting Linux desktops in front of their municipal employees. I mean, really, I just can&#39;t see <em>my</em> Dad using ifconfig to fiddle with his network settings. Only recently has Linux distributions emerged that I would consider suggesting to my family, much less my family&#39;s coworkers. </p>

<p>(By contrast, of course, Linux as a <em>server</em> platform has had success for so long, and open source software is <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">clearly dominant</a> on the server.)</p>

<p>Ever since the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> campaign began a couple years ago, we have all seen how much it makes sense (in terms of attracting an audience) to focus on getting things to Just Work on a <em>personal computer</em>. Ubuntu has ridden the hype skyrocket right past Debian and Suse etc ... well, because they have a millionaire at the wheel ... but also because they have taken on the closed-source OS&#39;s head-on with regard to <em>usability.</em> They put a lot of time into making a Linux distribution that would recognize your iPod (and monitor and printer and keyboard ...) the first time you plugged it in. They even have a branch devoted to a kid-friendly version, <a href="http://www.edubuntu.org/">edubuntu</a>. And they have done a <a href="http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2006/01/01/breezy">lot of steady work</a> to make a more useable experience generally (even if they aren&#39;t rewriting the Gnome desktop). I think their <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">whole approach</a> deserves applause, despite all the remaining gotchas of linux. (Certainly there is not a Linux desktop the tops the Mac OS usability experience, in my opinion.)</p>

<p>Check out the recent preview of the <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2007/01/sneek-preview-of-expected-features-in.html">KDE desktop</a>, which has been designed by a <a href="http://www.oxygen-icons.org/">wonderfully talented, small team</a>.</p>

      <span class='timestamp'>

      <p>There are very few web design books that have any currency after about 2 years. Very few.
And half of these are notable because their very outdatedness is instructive. The rare remaining 50%
of this minority of web design books is the &quot;on-every-designer&#39;s-shelf&quot; collection. Among them is certainly Steve Krugman&#39;s &quot;Don&#39;t Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability.&quot;</p>

<p>It is, he writes, a book for &quot;people in the trenches &mdash; the designers, the developers, the site producers, the project managers, the marketing people, ... and the one man band people who are doing it themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>The rule, &quot;don&#39;t make me think&quot; is an obvious principle, but it can be translated many ways.</p>

<p>One great translation is the user&#39;s maxim &#39;the more difficult it is to use, the less I will use it.&quot; You must design for users, not yourself. Always second guess your new aesthetic vision, and, if at all possible, conduct a usability test with real users.</p>

<p>Another reformulation of the main theme is &quot;no one cares as much about your site as you do.&quot; And really, it <em>doesn&#39;t matter</em> to users if they understand everything about your site. (This is difficult for many developers, who are intensely interested in how online stuff works.) Users want to know how to use it to do specific tasks. This is the age-old (ie 1990s) principle of &quot;satisficing&quot; &mdash; being satisfied and sacrificing. If you expect more than 10% of your web page to be read by a single user, you have high expectations.</p>

<p>The corollary to this principle is that, if a user can make your site work for them, they will stick with it. Secondly, you must respect a counterintuitive fact: it is <em>difficult</em> to make a site simple and <em>easy</em> fill it with confusing design.  I am fond of saying that web design is a process of subtraction. There are a number of helpful hints for building subtrative process into your design method:
<ul>
    <li>Create a clear hierarchy from the beginning.</li>
    <li>Use conventions.</li>
    <li>Spend a lot of time on the navigation. Harness the power of links by focusing your design energy on that navigation bar.</li>
    <li>Remove words: Take out that useless banter.</li>
</ul>
Steps designed to ensure hierarchy, conventionality, easy navigation and conciseness are the basic rules of content development for the web.This is what it means to write for the web.</p>

<p>Krug also poses the wonderful &quot;Trunk Test of Web Usability&quot;:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. Print your page.</li>
  <li>2. Hold it at arms length and circle:</li>
  <li>a. The site name</li>
  <li>b. The sitewide search box</li>
  <li>c. The sitewide navigation</li>
  <li>d. The page name</li>
</ul>

<p>Does your site pass the test? Can you easily identify the most usable, important parts of your website? Yes, this is common sense, but, again you have to be sure: can your users really use your site easily?</p>

<p>There is also great chapter devoted to designing your home page, the most important page of your site. In brief, here are a few things that your colleagues (or inner slacker) may offer as excuses to creatign a truly usable site.</p>

<p>There is also great information about working with teams of developers. Namely, stay away from &quot;religious debates,&quot;
in which people are &quot;expressing strongly held personal beliefs about things that can&#39;t be proven.&quot; Contrast, for example, opinions about Macromedia Flash, the web&#39;s animation format. Some people (namely graphic designers and CEO&#39;s) love Flash. Some (namely me) don&#39;t care for it in most situations. Arguments begin. People waste their time going round and round with the religious debate about Flash. The way out of this cycle, Krug explains, is to ask: does this use of Flash in this situation, on this site, with this content and our users work?</p>

<p>Lastly, it must be recognized that Krug always carries to flame for testing: you must test your website, Krug writes. Stop thinking that usability tests cost $50,000. They cost closer to $100, if you have a tape recorder and a computer. Get a few of your potential users and let them tell you what is really happening on your web site. </p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/04/14/a-few-words-against-drivel-and-detritus/">A Few Words Against Drivel and Detritus</a> </h2>
      <span class='timestamp'> 
        Apr 14 2005
      </span>
      <p>Create usable content? It doesn&#39;t sound like a difficult goal. But upon reconsideration, it is clear that the web (in particular) has become a waste of  your time. The visual aspects of the internet are all distractions without quality content. And that means content that is useful and clear. </p>

<p>Is your website full of unclear, inconsistent, out-of-date, unrevised content? It&#39;s out of style; let&#39;s all move on together now as one happy sector. </p>

<p>So three cheers for web designer <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/">Keith Robinson&#39;s </a> focus this week on content. 
Here&#39;s a great sample from his post today: </p>

<blockquote class="large">
<strong>What Usable Content Is</strong>

    * Usable content is clear and easy to understand.
    * Usable content can bridge gaps: things like language barriers, disability and cultural differences.
    * Usable content is meaningful.
    * Usable content makes the reader feel smart.
    * Usable content is goal and audience appropriate.
    * It's thought-out, planned and constantly maintained.
    * It's fresh, light and lively.
    * It's content that is organized in a way that people understand and can get their mind around.
    * It's designed to be accessible.
    * It's reusable and shareable, readily available and easy to locate.
    * It's straightforward, open and honest and to the point.
    * It encourages feedback and is engineered for conversation.
    * It's hard work, but worthy of the job.

<strong>What Usable Content Is Not</strong>

    * Usable content is not clever, obtuse or misleading.
    * It's not marketing drivel, or bland branding messages.
    * It's not longwinded.
    * It's not written at the highest possible reading level.
    * It's doesn't use 'big words' unless they are needed.
    * It's not legalese.
    * It's not double talk.
    * It's not an afterthought.
    * It's not a mission statement.
    * It's not an org chart.
    * It's not self-centered.
