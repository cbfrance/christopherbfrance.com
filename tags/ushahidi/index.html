      <h2><a href="/2009/09/09/iccm-09-the-crisis-mapping-conference/">ICCM 09, the Crisis Mapping Conference</a> </h2>
      <span class='timestamp'>

      </span>
      <p>In October I&#39;ll be geeking out at the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/">ICCM 09</a>, the first International Conference on Crisis Mapping. The conference is &quot;harnessing mobile platforms, computational linguistics, geospatial technologies, and visual analytics to power effective early warning for rapid response to complex humanitarian emergencies.&quot; </p>

<p>If you&#39;re scratching your head wondering what the field of crisis mapping is all about ... you&#39;re not alone! Good thing Patrick Meier has proposed a <a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/proposing-crisis-mapping/">sketch of the field</a>. You have to love a guy who literally defines a field. Patrick is a collaborator at Ushahidi and Swift, and I have really been fortunate to see him at work, particularly his leadership in bridging academic and hacker-practitioner communities in this &quot;crisis&quot; space. It&#39;s the same thing that is making everyone so excited about this conference. Thanks, Patrick. </p>

<p>Cross-pollination at these conferences is incredibly important to our success. We&#39;re doing many of the same things over and over, with innovative twists appropriate to our context. We just don&#39;t know each other. Now we get to meet and work together for three days. I think it&#39;s terribly exciting because of an increasing sense that <em>we can all be doing these things much better</em>. </p>

<p>See also Crisis Camp West (Watch <a href="http://crisiscamp.org/">this space</a>, I think.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s this from the ICCM conference site:</p>

<blockquote>
The purpose of the 3-day conference to be held in Cleveland on October 16-18 is to bring together the most engaged practitioners, scholars, software developers and policymakers at the cutting edge of crisis mapping to define the future of the field along with best practices and lessons learned. We expect over 50 organizations to be represented and for multiple partnerships to be formed on specific projects during the conference. Please note this conference is by invitation only. See below for a list of invited partners.

<p>I hope to meet a few of my friends that I don&#39;t get to see enough, and meet a few new people working on great stuff. Check out the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/profiles/members/">people that are involved</a> and some of the <a href="http://crisismapping.ning.com/group/signupforignitetalks/forum/topics/add-your-ignite-talk-proposal">planned talks</a>. Probably there will be a lot of discussion about how to use <a href="http://swiftapp.org">Swift</a>, and I might be demoing a new project about the rapid deployment of applications like Ushahidi and Meedan.</p>

<del datetime="2009-09-11T12:12:36+00:00">Come out and hack on some amazing software! </del>

<p><strong>Correction: You can&#39;t come out and hack because (upon closer reading) it&#39;s apparently a closed conference. Frankly I&#39;m disappointed.</strong></p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/05/07/swift/">Swift</a> </h2>
      <span class='timestamp'> 
        May  7 2009
      </span>
      <p>For the last 5 months I&#39;ve been working with friends at <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> and <a href="http://meedan.net">Meedan</a> on a project nicknamed &quot;Swift.&quot;</p>

<p>Our goal with Swift is to provide a crowdsourcing platform for &quot;data triage.&quot; Imagine something like Mechanical Turk used only for tagging news, photos, microblogging and videos. There&#39;s no business model or anything like that &mdash; it&#39;s strictly Open Source Nonprofity Goodness(tm). Meedan and Ushahidi are partners in hacking it out.</p>

<p>As a user of Swift you can sit down at an &quot;assembly line&quot; of news and tag it. Swift gives you a straightforward aggregator for news (say, news about earthquakes in california) then asks you to tag all of the people, places and organizations in that firehose of data. With a little bit of effort (collecting a few rss feeds and marking up all the content) it becomes possible to put a very bright light on an emerging part of the web. You can, for example, tag violations of electoral code in an election, as we are doing with <a href="http://votereport.in">Vote Report India</a>, which uses Ushahidi and Wordpress as a platform for grassroots reporting in the month-long Indian election. </p>

<p>I&#39;m especially interested in knowing how much we can actually <em>do</em> with the public data that emerges in realtime during a crisis. From a journalistic perspective, it seems like there is an opportunity to understand more concretely <strong>what the hell is going on</strong>.</p>

<p>For Ushahidi, Swift is an extension of their exisiting SMS reporting cycle. By &quot;listening&quot; to the &quot;outside&quot; web in a more structured way, the hope is that we can provide more relevant alerts to people on the ground in a crisis. </p>

<p>For Meedan, Swift is a tool for a team of editors who need to produce interesting content for their digital newsroom. Because it is an aggregator, Swift serves naturally as a listening post as well as a tagging workbench. Rope in a few feeds (such as <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=election">Twitter search results feed for &quot;election&quot; </a>) and then do location extraction for the Middle East with <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">Calais</a> on that feed, and you have a pretty cool stream of entities.</p>

<p>Today we had a great meeting at InSTEDD, with a crazy good crowd of people &mdash; everybody was in town for the <a href="http://hrc.berkeley.edu/events/newmachineconference/">conference at Berkeley</a>. Thanks to everyone for their ideas and support!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my presentation from today:</p>

<p>[<a href="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=dashboardshort-090507011606-phpapp02&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=swift-update-may-6">http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=dashboardshort-090507011606-phpapp02&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=swift-update-may-6</a>]</p>

<p>All of the photos and links can be found on <a href="http://flickr.com/unthinkingly">my Flickr page</a>.</p>

<p>Swift seeks to publish all of the entities that concerned communities publish about crisis, both hot flash and slow burn events. The core use case is for the period immediately following a disaster or crisis, during the hours and days of confusion. </p>

<blockquote><ul><li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/swiftriver">The Swift Mailing List</a> </li>
    <li><a href="http://swiftapp.pbwiki.com/">The Wiki</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://swiftapp.org">The Website</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://github.com/ajturner/swiftriver/tree/master">github repo</a></li> </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing that is always interesting about Swift is that it is a very unusual use case. The tragedy of a crisis creates a temporary period of great social empathy during which many &quot;rules&quot; of interaction design break down. This is a design opportunity. Many people are willing to match their #have to someone else&#39;s #need, but they don&#39;t have a medium for volunteering, or a network of supporters who can contextualize and respect their work. We just watch CNN and feel powerless; we would love a way to help, as an individual, from across the world. An improved marketplace of volunteerism is possible if we can design the appropriate interactions.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2008/09/18/ushahidi-designs/">Ushahidi for the iPhone</a> </h2>

      <p>Update: The Ushahidi team has released a strong new open source iOS codebase. </p>

<p>After a few months of work, we have gotten a new wireframe of the mobile app running on the iPhone. </p>

<p>![][&quot;/images/ushahidi.jpg&quot; Hmm]</p>

<p>Lately I&#39;ve been volunteering a little bit for <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a>. Ushahidi is an open source tool for monitoring crises and disasters. It recently won the the <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2008/05/30/winning-the-netsquared-challenge/">NetSquared challenge</a> and was called one of the top startups to watch in the MIT Technology Review. Man, I really don&#39;t have to give up anything to work on this one &mdash; it&#39;s really a top notch operation going on. Other nonprofit and open source teams could learn a lot from the Ushahidi project. </p>

<p>Some of the amazing things about the Ushahidi project include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Participatory design. Everyone is invited to comment on these designs and <a href="/ushahidi/Ushahidi_v3b.psd">hack on the psd files we created</a>.</li>

    <li>Rapid prototyping. (Really rapid: the first version of the app was built in a weekend.)</li>

    <li>The application is completely open source. </li>

    <li>It's a platform, not a web application: you can get the code and extend it for your own uses.</li>

    <li>Strong user-centered design principles.</li>

    <li>Great attention to detail in the design and insistence on top-notch interfaces (including the marketing website and the admin pages of the application).</li>

</ul>

<p>Anyway here&#39;s the latest mockup. Here&#39;s the latest<a href="/ushahidi/Ushahidi_v3b.psd">source PSD</a>. It&#39;s v0.2 and still has a long way to go. We did the iPhone app first and will be using lessons learned from this one to port the project to other platforms. </p>

<p>[<a href="http://whiteafrican.com/images/ushahidi_iphone_v02a-500x310.jpg">http://whiteafrican.com/images/ushahidi_iphone_v02a-500x310.jpg</a>]</p>

<p>I did most of the sketching and developed the concepts that were flying around, and then my man Joe Jones did all the real work in Photoshop. It&#39;s been a really fun time so far and I am looking forward to implementing some of the changes being discussed on the <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi blog</a>.  </p>
