      <p>Andy Carvin, director of the Digital Divide Network, recently posted a fascinating, heartbreaking perspective just how much damage has been done. He found the images at a strange condo site, <a href="http://katrina05.blogspot.com/">condobuzz.com</a>. The images are overlays of the flooding with other metropolitan areas. (Note this is <em>just the flooding</em>. The hurricane damages, if in the midwest, would reach from Detroit to Chicago.) Andy&#39;s excellent, popular, collaborative Katrina blog is here:

      <p><em>With a nod to International Blogging for Disaster Relief Day (Friday, Sept. 2).  ... Crossposted on the DDN list.</em></p>

<p>I am beginning research into ways in which mapping technologies like GIS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gis">wikipedia: GIS</a>) are being used (and can potentially be used) to help avert or cope with humanitarian disasters.</p>

<p>The tragedy of New Orleans has given me some insight into the potential and limitations for this use of geospatial technologies. <img alt="New Orleans below sea level" src="/images/NO-below-Sea-level.jpg" />
Thanks to Andy Carvin for applying his blogging/networking skills to this problem and prompting this line of thinking (<a href="http://katrina05.blogspot.com/">The Katrina Aftermath Blog</a>) . Recent discussion on the <a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/community/digitaldivide">Digital Divide List</a> of geocoded pictures has also been stimulating.</p>

<p>GIS is a sophisticated, robust technology that is being used to map and analyze data in numerous fields, especially environmental studies and public health. One of the most compelling features of GIS research is that it takes advantage of the contemporary wealth of data that is collected by all kinds of environmental monitors. (eg: weather is monitored constantly, and thus existing weather datasets can be mapped geospatially to discover, for example, patterns in flooding or to predict the best time to plant crops.)</p>

<p>New Orleans has for some time been the subject of extensive GIS research because of its precarious position below sea level. The availability of this technology has, I feel certain, prevented or alleviated numerous problems created by the hurricane (perhaps, for example, by helping prepare the safest evacuation routes years ago). I am interested in discovering similar, existing applications for GIS in poorer parts of the world. I would also like to find discussion/research of <em>potential</em> uses, especially, again, in the context of poverty.</p>

<p><img alt="niger" src="/images/niger-small.jpg">Cusory searches of the internet  find that there certainly exists a great deal of straightforward mapping going on in terms of humanitarian crises, most notably (according to my notes) the indexes on <a href="http://www.Reliefweb.int">Reliefweb.int</a>. These are extremely useful documents for creating awareness, but they are also rich, multilayerd documents for use by the aid workers and activists that cope with these problems daily. A .pdf file of the crisis in Niger, for example, can be a great way to understand the scope of the problem, but it also can direct the triage more effectively. </p>

<p>The center for New Orleans GIS research is at Louisiana State University; they have an excellent <a href="http://www.publichealth.hurricane.lsu.edu">website</a> that distributes their GIS data to the folks in the government that need the information. I doubt that there is any much more sophisticated model of GIS research. What fascinates me is that, although I am new to GIS, it appears that there is a strong &quot;open source sensibility&quot; about most GIS-- the information is provided free (though sometimes to a limited set of users) and is intended for extended, unmonitored use. How can this be expanded and reproduced in a way that promotes human development?</p>

      <h2><a href="/2005/03/13/learning-internet-think-in-uzbekistan/">Learning internet-think in Uzbekistan</a> </h2>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net">Digital Divide Network</a> has a wonderful, thoughtful article on the use of the internet and computers in Uzbekistan, where students and teachers face both poverty and technological illiteracy. </p>

<p>A recurring question in international technology development is the relevance and local meaning of the technology &mdash; what if I have never used a computer? Does getting one really do anything without education behind it? More accurately, I think: How useful is my new laptop if it is the only source of light in my home? (That&#39;s a <a href="http://laptop.media.mit.edu/">real example</a>, I&#39;m afraid.)</p>

<p>Technology is a tool and a process. The use of technology requires learning a skillset. This article provides an incisive look at just how hard this education can be in the real world.  </p>

<blockquote class="large">Still struggling to free itself from a Soviet educational model, Uzbekistan's school system is on the verge of disintegration. Teacher salaries in the regions can average $20 a month. Few schools have working heat to warm them through the cold months, and electricity outages during the winter are the rule rather than the exception. Textbooks are often out-of-date or unavailable.

The Soviet system &mdash; which did install equipment in many schools long ago &mdash; saw computers as an end to themselves. Students were taught basic programming in "informatics" classes. Given their primitive state, the concept of using the computers for lessons other than those specifically about computers was never offered nor supported. For most of the day, computers remained untouched &mdash; gathering dust in a locked classroom, or occasionally displayed to visiting delegations as evidence of progress. This attitude towards computers remains to this day.</blockquote>
