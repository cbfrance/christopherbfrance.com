Learning to use CSS can make you insane if you don't have a good instructor. And who does?

Some of the best advice I've ever gotten about web communication relates to debugging your code: you have to learn to problem solve efficiently. 

Enter Mezzoblue's <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/css/cribsheet/">CSS Crib Sheet</a>, may it's url never expire. 



<blockquote>You will no doubt come across many quirky layout issues when building a site with CSS. You'll end up banging your head against a wall time and again. This is an attempt to make the design process easier, and provide a quick reference to check when you run into trouble.  </blockquote>

I also recommend the <a href="http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/03/10/css_problem/">attendant conversation</a>, which has whole shmear of mostly excellent advice (I don't recommend removing your DOCTYPE permanently, as one contributor recommends. Everything else is golden advice on this page.)
