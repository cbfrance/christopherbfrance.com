The Linc project (based in NY) has an interesting article on their use of del.icio.us (a web service that maintains lists of links for you.) I really appreciated their technical description of everything they're doing with it, but it isn't a beach read.

Here's a bit:

<blockquote class="large">
Are you maintaining lists of links someplace and looking for a way to keep them up-to-date?

You might consider taking a look at del.icio.us, a free service that will allow you to aggregate links on their system, tag them with category names of your own choosing and then display them in other forums.</blockquote>
