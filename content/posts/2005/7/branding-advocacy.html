Here's an interesting article from an old Harvard Business School <em>Working Knowledge</em> series. It's about branding, which from my perspective is a very diffucult thing to incorporate in online communications.

This can mean that implementing activities that protect the brand or attempting to update or modify the brand often meets with resistance internally. In some cases, highly decentralized organizations such as Medecins Sans Frontiers [also known as Doctors without Borders] depend on their brand to provide organization cohesion. The brand is the glue holding the components of the global organization together.</blockquote>
