Evaluation is an important, albeit rarefied, science of promoting nonprofit organizations. Do you need to measure the effectiveness of a specific program -- or your entire organization? Well, there's an entire discipline devoted to helping you do just that. 

Unfortunately, as with most rarefied, important sciences, the "discipline" part tends to mean something more like "punishment," rather than "a codified mode of study." 
At any rate, doing a real, formal evaluation of a program is still better than wasting your time doing something that's useless, fruitless, a waste of energy or just a sham. So here's a buch of resources from the internet to help you get going for free. Thanks for this post go to Joyce B. Morris and David Colton, Ph.D., from the EvalTALK Listserv.

"Also, there are some good, free resources on the Internet and from state and federal government agencies.  For example, you can order "Introduction to Program Evaluation for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs" (2001) from the CDC (www.cdc.gov/tobacco).  Don't be turned off by the reference to tobacco control as that is used for context.  The "<a href="http://www.wkkf.org/Pubs/Tools/Evaluation/Pub770.pdf">W.K. Kellogg Foundation Evaluation Handbook</a>" can be ordered from the foundation or is available as a free download in pdf format
