Andy Carvin, director of the Digital Divide Network, recently posted a fascinating, heartbreaking perspective just how much damage has been done. He found the images at a strange condo site, <a href="http://katrina05.blogspot.com/">condobuzz.com</a>. The images are overlays of the flooding with other metropolitan areas. (Note this is <em>just the flooding</em>. The hurricane damages, if in the midwest, would reach from Detroit to Chicago.) Andy's excellent, popular, collaborative Katrina blog is here:
