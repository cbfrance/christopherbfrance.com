Just had a really great first experience at <a href"http://alpha.qunu.com">Qunu</a> asking obscure questions about our email server. It was an obscure subject, but I needed generalized advice, so I didn't have a listserv (such as a particular software group) to turn to immediately. I was able to connect to a geek in a few minutes and have, basically, a web-based IM chat. Highly recommended if you need computer-related advice. I think there were probably only a few people online that I would have trusted as experts in this particular field, but hell, that's pretty great considering it's alpha. I hope the service grows. God bless the web.
