As a web developer, I am a sucker for great tools. Signal Vs. Noise makes some of the best web-based applications I have ever used, and they have a thread for all of their readers (36,000+ really smart RSS subscribers) to <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/158-link-it-up-the-tools-you-use">post the stuff that they are using</a>.

Note the preponderance of mac stuff. 

Softwarewise I really am overdue to give appreciation to my favorite independent software artists: 


<ul>
	<li>Iridesco, creators of <a href="http://www.harvest.com">Harvest</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>, Creators of Transmit (ftp) and Unison (yes, usenet still exists)</li>
	<li>Ranchero, makers of <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/">FlyingMeat</a>, maker of VoodooPad, in which I have hundreds of scribbled notes. </li>
	<li>and of course <a href="http://macromates.com/">Macromates</a>, who make the most fantastic text editor ever (after you get over the lack of FTP integration and your BBedit muscle memory. Takes two weeks.)</li>
</ul>

If you are serious about a text editor, at least check out some of those <a href="http://macromates.com/screencasts">demo videos</a> on their site.
