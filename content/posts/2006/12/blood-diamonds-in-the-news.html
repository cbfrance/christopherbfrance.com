Ethan Zuckerman has a <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/">great post</a> about the recent newsines (trendiness?) about "conflict" diamonds, pointing to a parody site <a href="http://realdiamondfacts.org/">realdiamondfacts.org</a>. It's a sendup of DeBeers and Co. (It's an exact parody of their PR-campaign website, <a href="http://www.diamondfacts.org/">diamondfacts.org</a>.)

The bigger issue, Zuckerman points out, is that there are any number of products that the Rich Folks of the world are consuming that cause economic and social trauma in the same way that the diamond industry does (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1468772.stm">Coltran</a> -- used in my cellphone -- seems to be worse than diamonds if you ask me ... ).
