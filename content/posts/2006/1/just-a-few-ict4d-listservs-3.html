Listservs are always so easy to miss. Sometimes they're a joy and sometimes they're dead, but they're always elusive, popping up just when you think you know every fold of your little online landscape. So, at the risk of being pedestrian, here's a few quick links from super-excited <a href="http://ict4d-think.blogspot.com/">Carole</a>. 

<blockquote class="large">
Information Society: Voices from the South - http://www.dgroups.org/groups/is - good for a time, more philosophical than practical

Ictforruralwomen (http://list.matrixlinks.ca/mailman/listinfo/ictforruralwomen) - really good but high volume

Oke-Ogun Community Development Agenda 2000 Plus - see www.cawd.info, and here's their contact and info: http://www.cawd.info/content/aboutus/contact_us.html

Voluntary Sector Forum (http://www.voluntary-sector.ca/eng/index.cfm) - useless unless you're in non-profit sector advocacy in Canada

Nonprofit Online News - great & diverse NGO/IT links

Open Forum on Telecentres and Development (seems to be telecentres-l@lyris.idrc.ca, or surf on www.IDRC.ca)

Bellanet (seems to be bellanet-l@lyris.bellanet.org)

AfricaFiles InfoServ (www.africafiles.org) - good for various African topics; no IT component </blockquote>
