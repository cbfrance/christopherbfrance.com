title: Biofuels Community with Google Maps
excerpt: Google maps offers the tools (an API) for creating maps using their interface, and this is an example of what I'm creating for the local Piedmont Biofuels community website.

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/biofuelsmap.jpg' alt='biofuels-map' /> <a href="http://www.ultramegaok.com/biodiesel/stations.html">This Washington state map</a> is an example of what <a href="http://www.nonprofitdesign.org">nonprofitdesign.org</a> is creating for my local (NC) biofuels community website (in the works).

This new biofuels website, I hope, will have a map that functions better than most of the buggy hatchet-jobs out there (above site excepted, of course).

There are a lot of directions that can be taken regarding an interactive map, i.e.: Google API (AJAX) vs. Yahoo API (Flash), local vs. national, user-editable vs. administrator-operated. I'm currently soliciting help from other programmers online and of about our options, because I don't have a lot of advanced Javascript under my belt. Personally, I want to see two major features:

<p>
1. Images of the pumps included in each "pin" on the map (for orientation).
2. Community-editable, not completely administrator-run.
</p>

As for the NC Biofuels community website as a whole, I hope to achieve three things:

<p>
1.) Share technical information about their experience in making + using biofuels. I would like to include references, for example, to articles in academic journals. (Using RSS syndication, this could be largely automated, and it would be as current as can be.)
</p>
<p>
2.) Find information about current local legislation, and easily email relevant legislators. This is easy enough to implement with PHP. 
</p>

The third, most important goal (though I think this has to come after the above 2) is to create a centralized place for dialogue. To do this I would like to offer blogs to each of the current biofuels operations in NC. (Though I doubt most of them could keep up with <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/blog/">Lyle "Energy Blog" Estill</a> at <a href="http://www.biofuels.coop/">Piedmont Biofuels</a>.) 


We could syndicate all of their posts on the community site so you can read everyone's posts in one place. Likewise we could create a tag for use in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati </a>and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a>. (Something like NCbiofuels.) 

(Using tags to create a close community online has certainly worked well for the nptech folks in recent months, though it is easier because we're all geeks. But even if just a few people used it for photosharing it would work well enough.)

And we could also have a more traditional bulletin board for on-site conversations. (Probably using <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/">PhpBB</a>, if I have my druthers.) And I think that a really comprehensive "Upcoming NC biofuels events" page would be an important result of this online community building.

I know that all of these things are happening already online in the community, but I want to magnify and multiply the network. I don't want to replace, just republish and distribute widely.</p>
