Do you work with interviews or documents in which you have to make meaningful correlations between themes? 

Perhaps you have a lot of data from interviews and you want to know what your respondents associate with a problem. 

Atlas.Ti isn't new, but you may have missed the boat. It provides a visual way of organizing and coding data for this type of research projects, especially those involving qualitative data, or data that can't be understood using traditional statistical methods. 

All the best research, right?

It's relatively easy to learn, fun to use, and incredibly powerful in the right context.  

For a few years now, it has had increasingly powerful support for video and audio coding, which means that you can analyze data from almost any source imaginable. Here's a blurb:

<blockquote class="large">
"ATLAS.ti serves as a powerful utility for qualitative analysis, particularly of larger bodies of textual, graphical, audio, and video data. The content or subject matter of these materials is in no way limited to any one particular field of scientific or scholarly investigation. The typical application areas for ATLAS.ti are characterized by a systematic, yet creative approach to analyzing unstructured data."
