Hi! I'm Chris Blow, I'm a nonprofit interaction designer (whatever that means). I work for <a href="http://meedan.net">Meedan</a> and volunteer for <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a>, as well as a few other little nonprofity and open source things here and there. Please send me an email with this handy little annoying form. Or you can just email me at unthinkingly at gmail dot com. Hell, you can call me if you've got something exciting to say: 415-309-7900. Thanks!
