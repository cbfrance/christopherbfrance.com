I have been trying to quit programming for about six months. 

I'm down to about 2 times a day, on average, sometimes more. It's a problem. 

Don't get me wrong, programming is one of the best disciplines I ever stuck my nose into. Programming teaches you fundamentally how to <em>constantly improve your craft</em>. But it's exhausting, distracting, and inseparable from the cult of efficiency. It takes you away from humans, mashes your nose into an LCD all night, and leaves you with a delusional sense of total control over your environment. I wish that I could take back every second of my life that I spent learning to build stacks and refactor my own crappy code. 

The problem is that code is so damn useful. It beckons with APIs and gives you entire weekends of mindless flow; hack, hack, hack, make it pretty and fast.

So anyway, I'm working on it.
