It's been a good book month for interface geeks and IXD/UX people. Congrats to AP on the new book and kudos especially to upstart publisher Rosenfeld for the innovative stuff they are doing, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Subject-Change-Creating-Products-Uncertain/dp/0596516835/ref=tag_tdp_sv_edpp_i">user testing of their 500-page, large font digital versions</a>. Rock on, you madcap publishers you. You're gonna make it big working like that.

All of these are worth buying (plus extra to give to clients):
