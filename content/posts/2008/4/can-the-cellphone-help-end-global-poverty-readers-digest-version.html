So I went to this Street Hacks talk 2 nights ago is here: <a href="http://www.janchipchase.com/ ">http://www.janchipchase.com/ </a> (it was awesome, you missed it. <a href="http://">Clam Pizza.</a>) And then it turns out Chipchase just got all famous this week, <em>seriously</em>: First a rad <a href="http://audiovideo.economist.com/?fr_chl=8094fc97a897f95d4bf846ee51a4214809017977">video in the Economist</a>:

And then <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html?pagewanted=1">in the New York Times</a>. 

Here's my Reader's Digest version, since I know you graphing how much time you spend on blogs. 

<strong>About Chipchase, who really is a super-nice guy:</strong>
	
<blockquote class="long">
"To an outsider, the job can seem decidedly oblique. <strong>His mission, broadly defined, is to peer into the lives of other people, accumulating as much knowledge as possible about human behavior so that he can feed helpful bits of information back to the company — to the squads of designers and technologists and marketing people who may never have set foot in a Vietnamese barbershop </strong>but who would appreciate it greatly if that barber someday were to buy a Nokia. ... </blockquote>



<strong>About getting over your hatred of your cellphone (cursed device efficiency-obsession). This bit hit a nerve for me:</strong>

<blockquote class="long">Understanding [stuff] requires forgetting for a moment about your own love-hate relationship with your cellphone, or iPhone, or BlackBerry. Something that’s mostly a convenience booster for those of us with a full complement of technology at our disposal — land-lines, Internet connections, TVs, cars — can be a life-saver to someone with fewer ways to access information. ... Jan Chipchase and his user-research colleagues at Nokia can rattle off example upon example of the cellphone’s ability to increase people’s productivity and well-being, mostly because of the simple fact that they can be reached. There’s the live-in housekeeper in China who was more or less an indentured servant until she got a cellphone so that new customers could call and book her services. Or the porter who spent his days hanging around outside of department stores and construction sites hoping to be hired to carry other people’s loads but now, with a cellphone, can go only where the jobs are. <strong>Having a call-back number, Chipchase likes to say, is having a fixed identity point, which, inside of populations that are constantly on the move — displaced by war, floods, drought or faltering economies</strong> — can be immensely valuable both as a means of keeping in touch with home communities and as a business tool.</blockquote>

<strong>On the incredible value that can be provided by something so simple, like SMS: </strong>

<blockquote class="long">"... public health workers in South Africa now send text messages to tuberculosis patients with reminders to take their medication. In Kenya, people can use S.M.S. to ask anonymous questions about culturally taboo subjects like AIDS, breast cancer and sexually transmitted diseases, receiving prompt answers from health experts for no charge.</blockquote>

<strong>On Microfinance and the bottom of the Pyramid:</strong>

<blockquote class="long">
... A cellphone in the hands of an Indian fisherman who uses it to grow his business — which presumably gives him more resources to feed, clothe, educate and safeguard his family — represents a textbook case of bottom-up economic development, a way of empowering individuals by encouraging entrepreneurship as opposed to more traditional top-down approaches in which aid money must filter through a bureaucratic chain before reaching its beneficiaries, who by virtue of the process are rendered passive recipients.</blockquote>


<strong>On "sente," which as Chipchase put it the other night, "turns anyone with a cellphone into an ATM:" </strong>

<blockquote class="long">Someone working in Kampala, for instance, who wishes to send the equivalent of $5 back to his mother in a village will buy a $5 prepaid airtime card, but rather than entering the code into his own phone, he will call the village phone operator (“phone ladies” often run their businesses from small kiosks) and read the code to her. She then uses the airtime for her phone and completes the transaction by giving the man’s mother the money, minus a small commission. “It’s a rather ingenious practice,” Chipchase says, “an example of grass-roots innovation, in which people create new uses for technology based on need.”</blockquote>


<strong>And then my favorite part, thinking about the pace of change and the <em>oh noes!</em> of the human condition: </strong>

<blockquote class="long">“People can think, yeah, monks with cellphones, and tsk, tsk, and what is the world coming to?” he said. “But if you wanted to take phones away from anybody in this world who has them, they’d probably say: ‘You’re going to have to fight me for it. Are you going to take my sewer and water away too?’ And maybe you can’t put communication on the same level as running water, but some people would. And I think in some contexts, it’s quite viable as a fundamental right.” He paused a beat to let this sink in, then added, with just a touch of edge, “People once believed that people in other cultures might not benefit from having books either.”</blockquote>

<strong>And then my other favorite part, their research methodology, an "open design studio" in Ghana: </strong>

<blockquote class="long">"There was a sheet of fabric strung up in front, with neat painted lettering that read: “Your Dream Phone. Share it with the world.” It went on to describe how the community was invited to come share ideas and drawings for the ideal mobile phone. Prizes were offered. So far, 140 people had shown up to sketch their dream phone."
</blockquote>
<strong>
And on the Election Violence in Kenya (check out <a href="http://ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi.com</a> created by Erik Hersman, who told me that this article had been published today!): </strong>

<blockquote class="long">"After the government imposed a media blackout in late December last year, Kenyans sought news and information via S.M.S. messages on their phones and used them to track down friends and family who’d fled their homes. Many also reported receiving unsolicited text messages to take up arms. The government responded with an admonition, sent, of course, via S.M.S.: 'The Ministry of Internal Security urges you to please desist from sending or forwarding any S.M.S. that may cause public unrest. This may lead to your prosecution.' "</blockquote>
