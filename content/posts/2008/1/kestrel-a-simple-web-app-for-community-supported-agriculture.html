I'm just getting started on a new project nicknamed Kestrel. 

The basic idea a simple and user-centered web app that helps facilitate ordering, billing and member management for CSA's. Things are JUST getting started and I am soliciting help in doing some feasibility research as well as a basic evaluation of existing CSA management applications. 

<blockquote> 
A CSA, (for Community Supported Agriculture) is a way for the food buying public to create a relationship with a farm and to receive a weekly basket of produce. By making a financial commitment to a farm, people become "members" (or "shareholders," or "subscribers") of the CSA. <span class="attribution"><a href="http://www.localharvest.org/csa/">Local Harvest</a></span>
</blockquote>
So far were in stage zero: Over the holidays I was brainstorming with some of my agri-geek friends in North Carolina, notably <a href="http://truefood.wordpress.com/">tes thraves</a>. (I like to say that tes is to poverty + agriculture issues as Jay-Z is to hip-hop -- a badass producer who just makes things happen.)  :) So far there's been a lot of excitement about it from both consumers and producers. 
<ul>
<li>Stage zero is lots of talk over drinks around the New Year's bonfire, basically. Check.
</li>
<li>Stage one is research about what real CSA's need. 
</li>
<li>Stage two is getting a few CSA's to pilot test a first iteration for a season. 
</li>
<li>The rest is iterating and improving based on real feedback. This is the hard part. And the fun part.
</li>

The only real spec so far is an application that is incredibly simple and driven purely by a real understanding of the users' needs.

There is no timeframe yet. I imagine things could take a year or so; nobody's getting paid by Kestrel. 

Codewise, I've done some simple scaffolding of the application, but really I think the requirements for this type of thing are simple -- the codebase is not really the issue. Just a few forms, login/out and billing. So I'm not looking for help from coders as much as I am trying to garner some interest from A) the users of the application, farmers and consumers and B) people with experience in user-centered application design and user testing.

The goal is a management tool that would simplify the process of ordering food from your CSA, but also serve as an educational model of CSA best practices. 

Right now I'm thinking a hosted solution, almost certainly built in Rails. And of course completely Open and Free.

<strong>The basic use case comes from my mom</strong> : she doesn't like very much lettuce in her box. Last year she got six heads of lettuce at a time. So ideally mom could just login and set her preference, pay her bill, update her address, give notice that she's out of town for a month, etc. The farmer then knows exactly how many heads of lettuce to harvest, and can keep the rest in the ground until going to the market on Saturday. 

It's not a new idea, I know. There are several in San Francisco. I haven't seen them yet. But I am sure that they're not as good as they can be and I want to put the users at the front of developing a new open source solution.

CSA's are great for environmental, social and economic reasons. And they're really just a lot of freaking fun. So if you are a consumer or producer with opinions about what you'd like to see in this type of software, let me know in the comments or unthinkingly-at-gmail.com.
