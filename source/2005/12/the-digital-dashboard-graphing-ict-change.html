Here's an interesting feature from a nonprofit organization called the <a href="http://public.gov3.net/public_pages/limited/default.htm">gov3 Network</a>, which appears to be a kind of ICT government consultancy. They have a interesting feature on their website that dynamically draws data comparing a country (of your choice) to other countries with regard to their ICT-sector growth. 

Put a country and comparison region into this <a href="http://public.gov3.net/public_pages/limited/research/benchmarking/gov3_digital_dashboard.htm">Digital Dashboard</a>, and the result is a data-dense graph that is intended to give governments a sense of how quickly they are moving in the right (or wrong) direction for growing their tech sector. 

I think this could be a useful tool, but I'm wary of private organizations seeking (lobbying?) for "more proper" regulation of the ICT sector as being a thin veil for simply giving opportunity to industry, not people. That said, they have a stated interest in promoting "a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society.Also, they've recently won an award at WSIS for <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/Homepage/fs/en">DirectGov</a>, a website that brings together a mess of information about UK government services.
