As a follow up to the previous post (see just below this one) please be 'ware that Global Voices is hosting an online (IRC) discussion of the handbook on Tuesday at 15:00 GMT (that's 11:00 AM, New York time). 

New to IRC chatting? It's simple. Here's instructions from the ground up:
					
<blockquote class="large">	<img alt="RSF-blogger-handbook" src="/images/RSF-blogger-handbook.png" width="150" height="150" />
 <p>1. Download &#038; install an IRC client for your computer. This is the program that will let you access IRC, just like a web browser is the program that lets you access web pages.  Here are links to IRC clients <a href="http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/platforms-windows.html"target="_blank">for Windows users</a> and for <a href="http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/platforms-macos.html"target="_blank">Mac users</a>.<br />
<em>(I use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/rt-messaging/chatzilla/"target="_blank">Chatzilla</a>, which works easily as a plugin with Mozilla Firefox browsers. <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/"target="_blank">Download it here</a>.)</em></p>

	<p>2. Connect to irc.freenode.net. How exactly you do this will depend on which client you install, but you should be able to find support pages online for any good client program.<br />
<em>(In Chatzilla, all you do is type irc://irc.freenode.net into your Firefox browswer window - but this only works </em><em>after </em>you&#8217;ve downloaded the Chatzilla plugin.)</p>
	<p>3. Once you are connected to irc.freenode.net, create a username for yourself. This will identify you to the other people in the IRC channels you join.</p>
	<p>4. Join the channel &#8220;globalvoices&#8221; - again, how you do this will depent on which client you&#8217;re using.<br />

<em>(In chatzilla, all you need to do is type irc://irc.freenode.net/#globalvoices into your Firefox browser window.)</em></p>
	<p>5. Once you&#8217;ve joined the channel, you&#8217;ll be able to see everything anyone else in that channel says, and you can say things to the rest of the channel. </p>
