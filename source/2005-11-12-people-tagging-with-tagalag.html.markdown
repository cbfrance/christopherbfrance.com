If you like the idea of tagging you web pages and your books, how about tagging your people? Sounds a bit like info-tainment to me, but I felt obligated to post it because of the compelling freakiness of it all.

It&rsquo;s not a &lsquo;tribute&rsquo; site like <a href="http://www.43people.com">43 people</a>, because only people who know a person&rsquo;s email address can add tags for that person.</p>
	<p>If you create a profile you can add personal and geographical information about yourself.</p>
	<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Tagalag is onto a viable business model, but I like the idea of tagging people. This could become interesting as it evolves.</p>
