I have been keeping track of things that are interesting on Delicious for some time now. 

Here're my top tags from September 2009 in case you are interested in checking out <a href="http://delicious.com/unthinkingly">my Delicious feed</a>.

    - design 425
    - development 174
    - ux 172
    - programming 166
    - opensource 149
    - ui 148
    - for_meedan 118
    - usability 114
    - journalism 96
    - mobile 95

I am working on several projects that use tags in slightly different ways, involving other specialized "social bookmarking" applications. I will post a note here when those feeds are ready! My current development activies (as a frontend coder and interaction designer) will be released over the course of 2008 at <a href="http://meedan.net">http://meedan.net</a> and <a href="http://swiftapp.org">http://swiftapp.org</a>.
