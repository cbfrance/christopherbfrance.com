SCENE: Atlas coffeeshop on 20th and Alabama, right now

ME: *clickety clickety

GUY #0: (in hushed tones) ... "So we've got these great new offices in San Mateo and a great team, I really think you'd be super interested in working with us. Kaleb says you're just ACE and that's all I need to know. This coffee IS the interview. ... We need someone ACE for this infrastructure cause we're planning on tens maybe HUNDREDS of thousands of users. Fast."

GUY #1: ... "You know, I just turned down an offer at Facebook even though it sounds a little exciting on account of the options."

GUY #0: "Well, we've got this designer and she's great. Asian. And, you know."

Guy #1:  "hot."

Guy # 0: "Yeah, hot."

Guy #1:  " Yeah so anyway I told them, sure  I'd love to be a facebook engineer, but you know I think this stage of my life is about INNER pleasures. My accountant said I made 175 this year just managing what I have."

Guy #0: "We can't match that. But don't you want to feel empowered, on a smaller team? You don't want to retire at 40, do you? Six hour days -- no problem."

Guy #1: " I think I'm going to open a holistic spa."
