The wacky bike was designed by IDEO people -- I'm also impressed with their recent riff on the magazine quiz (maybe think madlibs): A Rockefeller sponsored <a href="https://client.ideo.com/socialimpact/">guide to creating social impact</a> with your design firm.

<a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/">FrontlineSMS</a> is a thoroughly wonderful idea in many ways ... I mean, if you're into international rural research with mobile phones. A tool worth watching very closely, it's what I think is the leading platform of the mobile research "industry". (if there is such a thing.)

They just released a major new milestone and have bunch of great new branding. Great work, <a href="http://www.blogspot.kiwanja.net/">Ken</a>!
