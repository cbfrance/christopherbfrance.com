Bridge enables rapid translation of social media and the addition of important social and political annotations to facilitate cross-cultural understanding. 

The core translation features of Bridge were initially developed

With intelligent tools like dictionaries and glossaries, Bridge helps you translate efficiently and with confidence.

All content is portable and shareable, designed to be as seamless as sharing native social media. Open up new connections across linguistic, cultural and network divides.

The best translations involve a variety of skills â€” copy editing, grammar, spelling, a grasp of meaning and nuance. Bridge helps translators work collaboratively, with their individual contributions highlighted and recognized.

Bridge is generously supported by the Knight Foundation through a grant administered by the National Geographic Society.

Bridge is used by groups like [Translators Without Borders](https://translatorswithoutborders.org/), and [Taghreedat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taghreedat) for translation, research, and journalistic sourcing.
