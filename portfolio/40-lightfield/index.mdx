![I lead product design strategy at Lightfield. The market positioning relys on a sense of energic optimism in the face of a large, slow moving problem: conventional agriculture.](cover.png)

I co-founded LightField, which is a data startup dedicated to improving agricultural practice through new finanical mechanisms combined with organizational and social design.

LightField builds data-driven products that guide decision makers in identifying opportunities to invest in advancing a transition to [regenerative agriculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_agriculture). 

![In 2019 I led the design of our first product concept, RegenVest, which we have used to guide early stakeholder and market research conversations.](lightfield2.png)
