Meedan has a vision of a healthier, crosslingual internet. I helped build Meedan from concept to a team of more than a dozen people, serving as Director of User Experience and Design. 

Meedan has worked with hundreds of people around the world to translate millions of words. Meedan is committed to the potential of translation as a social good, both at home and globally, with a particular focus on enabling communities to support global journalism and civic engagement.

Meedan has led a number of groundbreaking crowdsourced translation and counter-misinformation projects through flagship products Bridge and Check.
