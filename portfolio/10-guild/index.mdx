![A concept I designed](cover.png)

The Data Guild has developed my commercial strategy and product orientation. 

As a lead member of our venture studio, I have been responsible for a wide range activity in a data-intensive environment. A typical day at the Guild would involve business process design, business development, hiring strategy and client services. 

On a daily basis I focus on prototyping new technical capacity, production designs and business plans. 

![I worked with one of the Guild partners to develop a systematic approach to cross-referncing our research (using Gatsby, React, GraphQL and the Airtable API) such that all of our internal research could be exposed with reference to external taxonomies such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.](guild3.png)

![We worked to position the Guild in the context of major social and environmental change. These concepts were used as part of a fundraising intiative. My goal was to use color to capture energy of the Guild mission while grounding it in statellite and microscopic imagery.](guild2.png)

![I developed playful illustration features to give a sense of fluency in a given domain — here "CEA" refers to contained environment agriculture, a technical domain. The design goal was to position the Guild as a expressive strategic leader with a sense of humor.](guild4.png)

![As I worked on the Guild market positioning I developed a thesis that we needed to explain some of the more serious aspects of climate change as top-line aspects of our brand. This unused concept explores a correspondingly "dark" theme for the Guild.](guild5.png)
