I am a lead member at [the Data Guild](https://thedataguild.com), a venture studio. At the Guild, I've supported data products in healthcare, life sciences, marketing, agriculture and climate change. I perform commercial product strategy and user experience engineering. 

At the Guild I have had the opportunity to work alongside world-class data scientists finding world-positive business models. We conceptualize and test new business models to find investable opportunity. 


The Guild is a type of venture studio (aka startup studio, a type of "portfolio entrepreneurship") which shares resources to rapidly create new companies. For example a venture studio may have a centralized mechanism for marketing, a streamlined leadership recruiting process, or a shared pool of technical specialists. (In the past, studios shared technical infrastructure such as server hosting, but this is much less of a barrier to entry for startups in 2020.) Commonly a larger studio (see: Expa or Science) will have an internal investment fund, which can relieve the pressure on founders, allowing them to focus on the mechanics of directly building the company.

The venture studio model is attractive because it situates companies in a community of builders. This helps de-risk the process and streamline the experimental flow.

The underlying questions facing any venture studio relate to allocation strategy and experiment design. What methodology do you use to arrive at decisions about which companies to create? And once you have conceptualized a new product company, how do you evaluate its success? Which operators will staff the product? How will we provision capital for a demonstrably good idea?

The Guild answers these questions by relying on a network of expert builders and a structured research cycle ("pods") to understand opportunities.

At the Guild I have played a cross-functional role as a product strategist. I moved between products where user experience work was needed. I have often worked on the Guild itself, as seen in some of the example images below. 

I also worked on experiments like [Faer](/faer) and [Layer](/layer).


<!-- ### The Guild Experiment

Can a venture studio model exist with strong emphasis on climate and data ethics? The Guild's background in consulting on world-positive themes had helped build a network of experts who were aligned around this concept.

Ultimately we found it difficult to raise a significant centralized fund which would allow the type of broad experimentation. -->

<!-- Sector-level opportunities were described in written analysis. Market-testing experiments are then devised based on promising prototypes and keyword resonance. The key measure of success for an early stage product is the ability to find early customers; product experiments which don't prove to be market-viable need to be closed down as rapidly as possible to preserve team focus.  

Previously, the Guild has also experimented with consulting models to work on grant-based products which could lead to commercial viability. For example, in 2016 we worked on [Faer](/faer), a healthcare messaging app which was funded by a innovation grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid. 

It's also possible to supplement the venture studio model with direct commercial consulting, which can lead to joint ventures.

In the future, the Guild will continue to refine its strategy to work on products that are a good fit for its mission orientation; climate change in particular is an emergent focus which has changed many parameters of the studio model. 

The Guild seems unlikely to directly pursue funding at this stage. (See my colleague Beau's take on [Starting A Climate Studio](https://teetotality.blog/posts/climate-venture-studios/).) -->

![I worked with one of the Guild partners to develop a systematic approach to cross-referencing our research (using Gatsby, React, GraphQL and the Airtable API) such that all of our internal research could be exposed with links to external taxonomies such as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.](guild3.png)

![We worked to position the Guild in the context of major social and environmental change. These concepts were used as part of a fundraising intiative. My goal was to use color to capture energy of the Guild mission while grounding it in statellite and microscopic imagery.](guild2.png)

![I developed playful illustration features to give a sense of fluency in a given domain — here "CEA" refers to contained environment agriculture, a technical domain. The design goal was to position the Guild as a expressive strategic leader with a sense of humor. My work on contained agriculture led to my work with as tech lead at Contain, a fintech startup serving indoor agriculture.](guild4.png)

![As I worked on the Guild market positioning I developed a thesis that we needed to explain some of the more serious aspects of climate change as top-line aspects of our brand. This unused concept explores a correspondingly "dark" theme for the Guild. The visual layering stratey would later be used for a Guild product spinout, Layer.](guild5.png)
