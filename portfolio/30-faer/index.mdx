Disparities in health in the United States have grown, leaving some urban cores on par with undeveloped nations. The rate of chronic illness such as diabetes, asthma, sickle cell disproportionately affect those who lack access to broader social services such as education and a high quality food supply. Addressing the chronic health needs of urban cores requires a holistic examination of these "social determinants" of health.

UIC hospitals in Chicago have developed an innovative technique for Community Health Workers who are trained non-medical staff working with people their own communities. The health worker model provides an essential "concierge" support layer for those facing illness.

### Hypothesis

The foundational premise of the health worker model being piloted in Chicago is that hospital teams need front-line personnel who go into communities and work with patients in their homes to find counseling, perform medical routines, strategize about healthcare, and find community resources.

Thus the core hypothesis of Faer is that these new types of healthcare teams will benefit from specialized communication tools.

The Data Guild collaborated with UIC to develop new communication strategies and tools for addressing the specific needs of health workers in this context. 

### Process

I led the design process on the Faer project, which was conducted during the winter of 2016. We relied on a series of in-context interviews and site visits to better understand the dynamics of the hospital, the patient's homes in Chicago.


### Observations

  - Digitized consumer care models are gaining popularity as a way to save costs and reduce the time burden of bureaucratic medical intervention.
  - Low-income communities have disproportionate health needs.
  - Children face serious logistical challenges making basic medical appointments, keeping up regular medical routines, and taking medication.
  - Urban hospitals are under-resourced, seeking new strategies for addressing both these low-income health problems.
  - Community health workers have emerged as a powerful healthcare technique for bridging economic and technical divides.


### Outcomes of the pilot

Our Faer pilot showed that secure, stable messaging platform can help scale the efforts of health workers both internally to the health care team and externally while working directly with patients. But there are numerous complex realities when dealing with hospital bureaucracy and underresourced urban populations. Automation and efficiency exist in tension with the sophistication of human care. Any software intervention in this context must be flexible enough to recede into the background behind the talented operation of a human operator, the health worker. Heavy-handed optimizations such as message bots can threaten to disrupt a delicate relational balance between the health worker and the patient. 


### Next questions

- Will the emergent community health worker model be effective at changing the underlying dynamics of social health, instead of merely serving to relieve pressure on emergency rooms?
- Can hospitals find funding models adequate to support health worker teams with appropriate salaries, or will health worker positions be low-wage, low-quality, short-term work?
- Can hospitals find qualified health workers to scale up the model?
- Can health worker tools become robust while still meeting patient privacy needs?
