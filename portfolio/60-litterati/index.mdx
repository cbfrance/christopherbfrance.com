![Concept: Can we imagine the Litterati data product as a game? I designed the Litterati "Data Editor" role as a supplement to the machine learning process that attempts to do better than simple Mechanical Turk style labeling factory. How can we treat data microtasking as an opportunity for civic engagement and genuine fun?](cover.png)


Litterati is a startup dedicated to community organizing for policy change. Litterati helps local teams of citizens organize to clean up beachfronts and urban areas. Users use an iOS or Android app to record images of the litter they collect; analysis of the litter data is used for strategic advocacy with governments and corporations. The Litterati app prominently uses machine learning to detect and automatically classify litter by brand, object type and material.

I have worked at Litterati as a data product strategist focused on optimizing data flow between team editors and a machine learning model. 

To help train the machine learning model, I developed an data table interface so that Litterati editors can manage tags that have been applied by users.

I also developed an information dashboard for users to see how their teams are progressing and to give an organization-wide view of the data being collected. 

I have also helped the team navigate a transition to open licensing.

For my technical work with Litterati my tools are Node, Firebase a React frontend.

![I built a data table (React and Firebase) to manage the human curation of annotation data for the machine learning pipeline and reporting. The table is a collaborative interface with multiplayer mode for real-time data jam sessions. My favorite part: The table uses reasonably intelligent autocomplete to maintain data quality without post-hoc validation. With this mechanism in place we have been able to align the Litterati litterat taxonomy with external categorization schemes (for example the U.N. litter taxonomy), strongly positioning Litterati as a data platform.](litterati3.png)
