I'm looking forward to getting this in the mail. I am excited to see a publication that is addressing this type of issue from a nonpolitical stance. (Or rather, I think, it is implicitly political). If you subscribe now you can still get the first issue from the <a href="http://www.needmagazine.com/" title="Need Magazine website">Need Magazine website</a>. </p>
