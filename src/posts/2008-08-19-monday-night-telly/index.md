For the User Experience people: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx1WveKV7aE">Bill Buxton is a genius.</a> Got me sketching. (And redefined "sketching.") 1.5 hr. lecture. Teaser: includes the phrase "Charlton Heston flying through the air." Oh and also please buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371">Sketching User Experiences</a>. Operators are standing by. 

For the type nerds: <a href="http://typeculture.com/academic_resource/movies/">Erik Speikermann is my idea of what real men are like.</a> The opening jingle made me shoot beer through my nose. 6 minutes. Just watch it. Check out his <a href="http://www.spiekermann.com/mten/index.html">blog</a> too. 

For Architecture Geeks: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8639555925486210852">Stewart Brand</a> is brilliant and insane. Fun SF footage too. Feature length PBS type thingy: Part 1 of 6.

For Anyone Who Uses a Computer: <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=engelbart&emb=0#">Doug Engelbart is my hero.</a> "Dealing lightning with both hands," indeed: this is the public debut of the freaking mouse, hypertext, screensharing <em>and</em> the networked office. This is where it all went down, in 1968 San Francisco (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Dormouse-Said-Counterculture-Personal/dp/0670033820">think about it</a>), to a standing ovation in a auditorium full of geeks who had their minds blown. (Bonus points if you know Stewart Brand's connection.) Long and really boring honestly. Use <a href="http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/1968Demo.html">this</a> like TV Guide, but watch the video on Youtube. If you look close you can see Skype crash.
