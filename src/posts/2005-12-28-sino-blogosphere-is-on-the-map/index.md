Ethan Zuckerman notes that the Chinese are starting to show up in (blog search engine) Technorati.com. 
 
<blockquote class="large">
Basically, the Chinese language blogosphere appears to be exploding in popularity. And the 12 Chinese blogs listed in Technorati's top 100 may be just the tip of the iceberg. ... I estimate that MSN is hosting a minimum of 2m Chinese language blogs, including Chinese and Taiwanese bloggers. </blockquote>
