There are some very sophisticated techniques emerging into the semi-mainstream this year. You may not have noticed, and you may not care. But if you can get the hang of it managing the blogosphere, there's a lot to be learned. 

Rediscover your interests and your profession with the new tools of online networking: Blogs, tags and syndication.

Even if you don't have a blog and don't want to publish content, this stuff is for you. ONE/Northwest has a good tutorial on a couple of the most important tools.

Are you drowning in email that you don't have time to read? And do you also feel a gnawing sense that you're missing out on critical information? Welcome to the paradox of the "information age." While we can't help you stop the world from turning, in this article we'll introduce you to Bloglines and del.icio.us, two exciting new tools that can help you tame your inbox, find relevant information that you're missing, and share it more effectively with your colleagues and allies.</blockquote>
