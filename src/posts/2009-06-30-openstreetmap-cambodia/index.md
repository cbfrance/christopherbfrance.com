I've been doing a series of presentations here <a href="/2009/06/29/sustainable-interaction-design-in-cambodia/">at the InSTEDD lab</a> in Phom Penh, and so far the best-received one has been (to my surprise) about something I really just getting into:  <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. I figured that this would be a good-spirited critical discussion about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">FOSS</a> philosophy given that <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009063026788/Business/Google-meeting-held-at-Royal-University.html">Google was in town</a>. :) I wasn't expecting it to be quite so engaging for the lab though &mdash; I think they all had a great time.

We did an introductory <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_party">mapping party</a> and I explained some of my appreciation for OSM, particularly the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Palestine_Gaza">Gaza mapping</a> that happened early this year.

I am an OSM newbie myself so I was just happy that we managed to get everything working end to end (using GPS devices kindly loaned by the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Foundation">OSM Foundation</a> &mdash; thanks <a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/">Mikel</a>!) Also thanks to <a href="http://thinkwhere.wordpress.com/">Chippy</a> for leading the OSM session last month that answered my questions about the OSM toolchain and gave me the idea for doing an intro party in Phonm Penh. I ripped off most of your presentation, Tim!
