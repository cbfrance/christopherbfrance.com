Softwarewise I really am overdue to give appreciation to my favorite independent software artists: 

<ul>
	<li>Iridesco, creators of <a href="http://www.harvest.com">Harvest</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>, Creators of Transmit (ftp) and Unison (yes, usenet still exists)</li>
	<li>Ranchero, makers of <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/">FlyingMeat</a>, maker of VoodooPad, in which I have hundreds of scribbled notes. </li>
	<li>and of course <a href="http://macromates.com/">Macromates</a>, who make the most fantastic text editor ever (after you get over the lack of FTP integration and your BBedit muscle memory. Takes two weeks.)</li>
</ul>

<img src="/static/images/textmate_icon.jpg" alt="textmate-icon" height="94" width="88">I think Textmate is the best software I have ever used: as an <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2006/06/19/blogging-from-Textmate/">external blogging client</a>, it makes blogging a freaking joy. If you are serious about a text editor, at least check out some of those <a href="http://macromates.com/screencasts">demo videos</a> on their site.
