The CPB has long been (um, in internet terms, I mean, that being all of 2005) a great resource for finding information about "blogging under fire." From their website, the CPB has several main purposes:

1.) A clearinghouse for information on incarcerated members of our community, as well as those whose lives have been taken from them because of their enthusiasm for the free exchange of information that blogging allows.

2.) A pressure group to force governments to free imprisoned bloggers, and make restitution for tortured and murdered ones.

3.) CPB will bring to bear the formidable communicative power of the blogosphere to keep pressure on governments to stop arresting and abusing bloggers and to mitigate or reverse measures designed to restrict speech.

4.) CPB will act as direct agents in negotiations to free imprisoned bloggers.

If you are interested and able, please visit their site or email them.

(FYI. I have no connection to CPB)
