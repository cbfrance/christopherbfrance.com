The Journal of Community Informatics, a new, academic approach to community technology, is now in its third issue. 

It has an informative, though often long-winded, selection of peer-reviewed articles. The field is new and often misunderstood or poorly defined &mdash; which makes it much more interesting to read the various perspectives that the researcher-authors bring.

Community Informatics (CI) is the study and the practice of enabling communities with Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs). CI seeks to work with communities towards the effective use of ICTs to improve their processes, achieve their objectives, overcome the "digital divides" that exist both within and between communities, and empower communities and citizens in the range of areas of ICT application including for health, cultural production, civic management, e-governance among others. The Journal of Community Informatics brings together a global range of academics, CI practitioners and national and multi-lateral policy makers. Each issue of the Journal of Community Informatics will contain double blind peer-reviewed research articles as well as commentaries by leading CI practitioners and policy makers.
