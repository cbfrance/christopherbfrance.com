I have been keeping track of things that are interesting on Delicious for some time now. 

Here're my top tags from September 2009 in case you are interested in checking out <a href="http://delicious.com/unthinkingly">my Delicious feed</a>.

    <ul>
        <li>design 425</li>
        <li>development 174</li>
        <li>ux 172</li>
        <li>programming 166</li>
        <li>opensource 149</li>
        <li>ui 148</li>
        <li>for_meedan 118</li>
        <li>usability 114</li>
        <li>journalism 96</li>
        <li>mobile 95</li>
    </ul>

I am working on several projects that use tags in slightly different ways, involving other specialized "social bookmarking" applications. I will post a note here when those feeds are ready! My current development activies (as a frontend coder and interaction designer) will be released over the course of 2008 at <a href="http://meedan.net">http://meedan.net</a> and <a href="http://swiftapp.org">http://swiftapp.org</a>.
