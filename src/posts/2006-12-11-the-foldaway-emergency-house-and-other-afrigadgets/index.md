<blockquote class="large">Rajan Harinarain, a South African entrepreneur and inventor has come up with a temporary foldaway house for use in emergency situations complete with electrical wiring and fittings, doors and windows that can be erected by a small team in 5 minutes.</blockquote><a href="http://Afrigadget.com">Afrigadget</a> is a great site (though with irregular posts) about a bunch of interesting developing-world-inspired inventions and tinkerers. Their most recent post covers a new type of emergency shelter. (Via <a href="http://jikomboe.com">Ndesanjo</a> on <a href="http://www.globalvoices.com">Global Voices</a>.)
