R. Johansson says it best. This is the single most important tool any web developer can have.

<a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Web Developer Extension 1.0</a>
for Firefox, Flock, and Mozilla has been released. There are many new features and bug fixes, so upgrading is highly recommended. The Web Developer Extension is a definite must have for any web professional, so if for some reason you don't already have it, download it <em>now</em>.
