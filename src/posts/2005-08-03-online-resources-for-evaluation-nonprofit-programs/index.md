Here's a link to a nice comparison of Google Scholar and Scrius. It points out that Google Scholar has become neglected and is no longer updated regularly. This is a super-unfortunate development; Google is the web's best hope for easy, inexpensive archiving of scholarly research. (In other news, however, Amazon is now offering scholarly articles for a fee. It's easy &mdash; they're delivered electronically, but they aren't cheap &mdash; about $5.00 per article.)

Here's the link to the Google article:
