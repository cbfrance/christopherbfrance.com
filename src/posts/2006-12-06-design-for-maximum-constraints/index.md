<img alt="flashlight" src="/static/images/light.jpg" />John Maeda writes thoughtfully about simplicity and design at his <a href="http://weblogs.media.mit.edu/SIMPLICITY/archives/000392.html" title="Maeda post">MIT-based blog</a>. He just posted a great bit about <a href="http://www.ide-international.org">Paul Polak's design</a> for a low-resouce flashlight. Design under difficult conditions can lead to the same creative insight as design on a limitless budget. <blockquote>"... this prototype flashlight that is completely solar powered (recharged in sunlight), easily constructed from common off-the-shelf parts, and can last for well over a decade of use.</blockquote>
