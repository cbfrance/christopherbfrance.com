I've never seen gadget hype reach the levels that have been achieved by the iPhone. And I've never been so caught up in it myself. After visiting <a href="http://www.eyesondarfur.org/">eyesondarfur.org</a> I've decided that I'm giving my iPhone budget to <a href="http://www.eyesondarfur.org/">Amnesty International</a>: $50 a month over the next year.

In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming">culture jamming</a> spirit I spliced an iPhone ad into one of the arresting images from the book <a href="https://secure3.ctsg.com/amnestyusa/store/viewProduct.asp?cookietest=1&From=%2Famnestyusa%2Fstore%2FviewProduct%2Easp&Product=600&CategoryName=New+Products&CategoryId=11">Darfur: Twenty Years of War and Genocide in Sudan</a>. I'm not anti-iPhone in particular: I just want to remind folks (<em>especially</em> myself) that there are more important things to focus on than the gadgets being thrust in your face. 

If you have the luxury of a budget for consumer electronics, why not consider putting just a percentage of it toward something like an anti-genocide campaign?
