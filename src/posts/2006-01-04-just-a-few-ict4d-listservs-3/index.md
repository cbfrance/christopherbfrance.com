Listservs are always so easy to miss. Sometimes they're a joy and sometimes they're dead, but they're always elusive, popping up just when you think you know every fold of your little online landscape. So, at the risk of being pedestrian, here's a few quick links from super-excited <a href="http://ict4d-think.blogspot.com/">Carole</a>. 

<blockquote class="large">
<ul>
  <li>Information Society: Voices from the South - http://www.dgroups.org/groups/is - good for a time, more philosophical than practical</li>

  <li>Ictforruralwomen (http://list.matrixlinks.ca/mailman/listinfo/ictforruralwomen) - really good but high volume</li>

  <li>Oke-Ogun Community Development Agenda 2000 Plus - see www.cawd.info, and here's their contact and info: http://www.cawd.info/content/aboutus/contact_us.html</li>

  <li>Voluntary Sector Forum (http://www.voluntary-sector.ca/eng/index.cfm) - useless unless you're in non-profit sector advocacy in Canada</li>

  <li>Nonprofit Online News - great & diverse NGO/IT links</li>

  <li>Open Forum on Telecentres and Development (seems to be telecentres-l@lyris.idrc.ca, or surf on www.IDRC.ca)</li>

  <li>Bellanet (seems to be bellanet-l@lyris.bellanet.org)</li>

  <li>AfricaFiles InfoServ (www.africafiles.org) - good for various African topics; no IT component</li></ul> </blockquote>
