Sometimes I think this site is just an excuse to migrate from one CMS to another. XD

For the last few years this content was hosted in Middleman, which is a great, stable environment for housing your words. I use Middleman a lot and had few complaints about it — I still use Middleman for a number of other sites such as <a href="http://meedan.com">meedan.com</a> and <a href="http://credibilitycoaltion.org">credibilitycoaltion.org</a>. 

I chose Middleman because most of my projects at the time were in Ruby — now most of my projects are in React, so I've switched to a React-based static site generator: [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org).

It's not been a totally smooth ride for me — it's still a relatively young project (though popular) and I'm still learning a lot about javascript. But I like the puzzle of learning how to do things in such a different way. The best part is getting more experience with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/ "GraphQL | A query language for your API").
