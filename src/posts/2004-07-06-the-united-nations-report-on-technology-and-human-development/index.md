Here's a great PDF version of a slightly dated &mdash; but far-seeing &mdash; report from the UN on the uses of emerging technologies in human development. It's optimism is tempered with a good deal of experience &mdash; it is clear that there is no single, technological solution to the problems of extreme poverty and inequality. Rather, technology is presented as being a key aspect of contemporary international development scholarship and praxis. This perspective, combined with their appreciation of the multitude of ways that technology is manifest, makes it an extremely worthwhile read.
