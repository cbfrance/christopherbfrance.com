Here's another update on the laptop debate/idea from Ethan Zuckerman, the ICT-blogger-fellow at Harvard. He usefully recounts the point of the new prototypical $100 laptop as being a radical step toward computer-aided learning in developing countries. I appreciate his skepticism about the project, especially his explicit reference to the late, not-so-great simputer idea, which bombed because of economics. 

You know, that pesky money thing. Always a problem when dealing with poverty.</p>

here's a bit: 
<blockquote class="money">
"After peppering Negroponte with two hours of questions, I&rsquo;m fairly convinced that this laptop won&rsquo;t suffer the problems the Simputer did - I believe it will get produced and distributed and that the software will enable e-books, web browsing, word processing and programming. As much as I enjoy the geekery of challenging Negroponte and others on the fine points of hardware and software design for the developing world, I&rsquo;m convinced that some extremely smart people are working very hard on the hardware and software side of things. While I might question some of the decisions made, I don&rsquo;t know that my second-guessing is helpful at this point.
