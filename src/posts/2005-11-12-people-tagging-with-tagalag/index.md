If you like the idea of tagging you web pages and your books, how about tagging your people? Sounds a bit like info-tainment to me, but I felt obligated to post it because of the compelling freakiness of it all. 



<blockquote class="large">
    <a href="http://www.tagalag.com">Tagalag</a> is a service that lets you tag <em>people</em>, via their email address. It&rsquo;s not a &lsquo;tribute&rsquo; site like <a href="http://www.43people.com">43 people</a>, because only people who know a person&rsquo;s email address can add tags for that person.


    
If you create a profile you can add personal and geographical information about yourself.


    
I don&rsquo;t know if Tagalag is onto a viable business model, but I like the idea of tagging people. This could become interesting as it evolves.

See also the recent surge of interest in Facebook, which about 80 percent of college kids are using. (No, really, 80 percent &mdash; I've seen other numbers that confirm this phenomenon.): <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch?m=387">Facebook Users sure are Passionate</a>
