An interesting article from the Washington Post, (via <a href="http://www.kenyanpundit.com/?p=113">Kenyanpundit</a>) :<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/13/AR2006011301730.html">African Rebels Take Their Battles Online</a>.


<blockquote class="large">
In countries where newspapers and radio stations are routinely shut down and dissidents are often jailed, the Internet is also giving ordinary Africans new freedom to debate political and social issues. "The Internet is a war weapon," Aboude Coulibaly, director of the New Forces rebel group in Ivory Coast, wrote in a recent e-mail. In 2002, the group used its Web site and TV station to launch a mutiny that toppled the government. "In these matters of revolution, we have to be wired to win," he wrote.</blockquote>
