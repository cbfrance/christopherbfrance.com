Brian Russell of<a href="http://www.audioactivism.org/"> Audio Activism</a> is putting together (along with a bunch of help, I'm sure he would modestly point out) the next Podcaster Conference in NC.  

I missed it last year, but I love the idea of a unconference:  "The event <strong>will not </strong>have traditional speakers, commercial product pitches, or bags full of conference swag. The event <strong>will have</strong> free food and drink, pre-organized sessions, and will be conducted in an unconference style."

If you want to learn about the wonderful world of grassroots audio production and how it's getting along, then check it out and come un-network. 

Where: 116 Murphey Hall, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC
When: Saturday, January 7, 2006 11am - 4pm
