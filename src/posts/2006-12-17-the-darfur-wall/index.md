The <a href="http://darfurwall.org/">Darfur Wall</a> is a beautifully executed charity project that fills a very simple, traditional purpose (collecting money) using an innovative and stark interface. The black and white, no-images design reinforces the tragedy of the situation without being overwhelming. I think this is a great example of online design serving a progressive cause &mdash; which is not so easy to find.
