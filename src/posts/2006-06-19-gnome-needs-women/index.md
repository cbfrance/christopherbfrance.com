Last I checked, only about 2 percent of developers were women. 

Just now read this: 

<blockquote   class="large">The GNOME Foundation received 181 applications for the Google Summer of Code (SoC) program, but not a single application was from a female developer. The lack of women participating in GNOME, and free software in general, has spurred the GNOME foundation to start a summer program to reach out to female developers.</blockquote>Amazing, considering that GNOME is a core element of open source desktops. (They make, um, the desktop.) And absolutely commendable for the GNOME open source team.
